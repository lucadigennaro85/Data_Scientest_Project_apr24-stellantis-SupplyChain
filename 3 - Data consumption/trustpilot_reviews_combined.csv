They offer you a package to “do the work for you” which is very enticing, but also something that is far easier to do on your own than they make it sound. Opening a bank account isn’t difficult, you have to create your LLC yourself anyway, and they do provide you with videos for most things related to your machine and getting started, which has been one of the most helpful things they provide.They will find you a bank, which honestly is not that difficult, set up the processing company - the only part that I feel was useful about the whole thing, and find you a location. The location finder service is very bad about setting you up meetings with places without first checking your availability or blatantly ignoring it, causing you to then have to call the company and explain to them that you cannot make the appointment that had been set up with them and try to make a new one. They will set up a group chat of dedicated people to help you and any question that you ask will immediately be responded to by multiple people saying “looping in @____” to the person you’ve already tagged in your question before getting an answer, and half the time I’m not even sure these are real people in the group chat.  They offer a Facebook group with other people with businesses where you can ask questions and get advice, but if your question looks bad on a location of theirs, the admin won’t even approve your post. They offer a guarantee of your machine either creating an income of $200/month or the option of offering you a replacement location OR $1000 of your money back, seriously pressing that the better deal is for them to find you new locations so that you will have multiple machines. However, if you take them up on this, they will inform you that by having purchased a new machine for the new location rather than relocating the original one, that you’ve voided this guarantee and will only find you one more location instead of the maximum of either 3 or 5 outlined in the guarantee. The location finder service guy has gotten passive aggressive with his answers regarding areas that I have specifically asked to avoid, and honestly if I could go back I wouldn’t have ever invested anything into this company.

Many users, myself included, assume that the displayed amount accurately reflects what will be credited to their wallets. After inserting $200, I was shocked to receive only $139—an astonishing 31% loss!The real issue is that Bitcoin Depot appears to rely on the assumption that most customers won’t double-check the BTC amount displayed. They present their fees in a way that seems straightforward, yet hidden and misleading fees are obscured, creating the illusion of a fair transaction. This practice can result in significant financial losses for unsuspecting users.Charging hidden and misleading fees is a serious problem, and companies like Bitcoin Depot should be required to display the full price upfront, including all applicable fees. Transparency is essential for consumers to make informed decisions and avoid being taken advantage of.To protect yourself, always verify the BTC amount displayed on the kiosk before finalizing your transaction. A quick online search for ""BTC to USD"" can help confirm if the amount you’re receiving is accurate and confirm if your being shortchanged.Moreover, beginning July 1, 2024, the “Honest Pricing Law” (SB 478) will make it illegal for businesses to advertise prices without including all required fees, excluding certain taxes and shipping costs. This raises significant questions about Bitcoin Depot’s pricing practices and compliance with consumer protection laws.While they claim that all fees are clearly displayed and that customers must agree to their terms, this does not absolve them of the responsibility for the confusion many users face. Their system can easily mislead those who are not familiar with cryptocurrency transactions.In conclusion, if you choose to use Bitcoin Depot, proceed with caution. Protect your hard-earned money by being proactive and informed. I highly recommend exploring alternative services that prioritize transparency and fair pricing. Your financial security is crucial—stay vigilant and informed.",323,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,1,-1

At the end of transaction it will tell you the amount you’re receiving s a Bitcoin amount and not as a usd amount that it conventionally shows the entire time until the end.

The fraud protection department does not have a phone number where you can directly get ahold of anyone to try and reclaim your transaction fees and ask clarifying question to submit to recoup the transaction fees.  They make it as difficult as possible for a victim to meet the 5 day deadline to complete a notarized affidavit and submit it.  I sent multiple clarification questions and yhouncy refused to answer them.  I was ignored by her for 2.5 days and then she waited to respond on another question that had to do with the affidavit until day 6 so that I wouldn't have my claim submitted in time.  They want a detailed submission and only give you 8 lines to write it in.  I stated I would type it up and sign it in front of the notary and attach it.  They refused to say if that would be accepted or not and then rejected my submission before even receiving the police report at the 15 day mark.  They are no better than the scammers and make money off of holding onto transaction fees from scammed money.  Their transaction fees are 23% which is a huge chunk of change in most cases.

I only received $1978 worth of Bitcoin. They charged me $842 in fees. I called they customer service and was told that they had a spreadsheet on what their fees were and that I accepted that fee schedule. I was sent a copy of the terms and conditions which after reading them, section 9.1's states that the machine would communicate with me on what the fees would be prior to me completing the transaction. And this never happened not once did a fee except for the $3 flat fee ever pop up on their screen. So then I emailed their support team to get a refund on that $842 only to be emailed back stating that before I even put the money in the machine I was informed on the screen the amount I would be charged.""The service fee will be a flat fee of three dollars ($3.00) and Bitcoin Depot shall charge a spread between seventeen and three tenths percent (17.3%) and fifty percent (50%) of the total transaction amount calculated in USD depending upon location.""But That's not true because they charge the flat fee plus a percentage of the total transaction amount and they would not have that total transaction amount until after you put your money in the machine. So it's all just a big lie to rip your money off. If you get ripped off go to the better Business bureau and file complaint with them like I'm doing. The Bitcoin Depot took 1/3 of the money I put in the machine for fees. I don't know if that's legal cuz it seems like it's stealing everybody's money",283,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,0

Due to my ridiculous living situation I have got myself in I have a very difficult time getting out of my purgatory so I am located in between of 2 Walmarts where where I can deposit into cashapp (and I recommend using in general but especially if the other option is this) and get my crypto from there very easily and my fee is 1 dollar. But halfway to either Walmart is one of these so I thought it would save me time and energy cuz I have to walk. So first 2 attempts to the same location machine was and still is down. So I decided to go to the other one. For starters the machine was janky but given the part of town didn’t expect much. I already set up my wallet and app on my phone and everything and never noticed fees but knew there would be sone. So get to the machine top right said $3 fee which isn’t good compared to my usual dollar but at the same time not outrageous. So I just wanted to deposit 70. Each bill I put in I didn’t know what was gonna happen and took a little bit to process each one. So come to my last bill it took it but didn’t process it nor did it spit it back to me. So I text CC and then after a few minutes I had to get back to my hole so I processed 65 and bummed cuz that and the 3 dollar fee. So walking back I email customer service who frankly don’t seem to care and sucked enlightened me that 70 was deposited and that I will receive my 50 dollars in bitcoin. So I didn’t lose the five that that way but instead found out that for using the atm on top of the 3 dollar fee they charge a 28% (that’s right 28% verbatim) just for using the atm. Which was explained to me like it was plastered everywhere and I know it did not state that anywhere and luckily enough sone of the pictures I took of the kiosk proved that it wasn’t located where they said or anywhere else.If you can and I’m sure for most people it would be easier anyway use any other way. I use both Cashapp and PayPal and both work extremely well and won’t take most or your money. The response I will give them was pretty fast. Even tho it’s bad news it’s like a bandaid. Also the app is janky and has no flow.",471,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,1

Crypto dispenser forced me to remove his name here but anyone can easily google the owner to find out who he is. I Experienced frequent delays and unresponsive calls/texts during the period of using his service. He often used my large funds to fund his smaller transactions on the website first,  causing months of delay for me. When my project passed deadline due to his delays and caused me significant financial losses, I asked him to cancel the transactions he's delayed and held. He THEN sends them through anyway just to make up volumn for his investors, charged me a big% fee on top. When confronted,  he promised the return of the fees on the transactions he made PASSING the promised delivery date  it's now 4 months later.  He's still dodging my calls,  txts, messages, still owe me thousands. My over all experience,  crypro dispenser is ran by someone who's not reliable, he promises the world when he wants your money,  then dodges your calls when he owes you. The owner thanked me on the phone because my volumn got him investors for his business, and then makes promises and disapears.  I'm still very upset that I can't locate him after my losses and his missing promises. I had all conversations and all my attempts to reach him recorded as evidence.

Mind you I’ve been a customer with this company for multiple years and would use the site more if the fees weren’t so high and capabilities so minimal. However they flooded my emails with this promotion to receive $25 for first deposit, when I did it I wasn’t impressed because once again after all the fees you end up earning about $5 give or take some change! I went on about my life and here they come in my email offering an incentive to encourage 5star reviews. They didn’t follow through or respond to my emails so I had to take to this public forum which triggered a response from them. The response was remove my second review or they won’t fulfill the reward and threatened to disable my account for “abusing bonuses” DID I MENTION THEY REACHED OUT TO ME IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE OF MY REVIEW. Needless to say I told them I WILL NOT REMOVE MY REVIEW UNTIL THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR END! Their response, sorry to have to do this but it’s come to our attention you are abusing rewards so we are disabling your account! That response came promptly and directed towards me personally not a generic response given by a computer. So they had found time to follow up on this matter when i inboxed them for about 3weeks with limited responses due to them claiming to be a startup business! They’ve been around for at least 3years, their phone number that is published on the internet is no connected but they have personnel available to disable accounts yet no one on their staff to pay their phone bill or get a service they can manage to keep! BAD BUSINESS!!!",396,Company has responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

I was encouraged to believe that I should have my bitcoin by the end of this past week. The call was helpful and amiable on both sides. At the end of the call I requested an email to be sent detailing all that had been discussed so that I would have it in writing. I was assured that I would receive an email that day and they requested my email address. As soon as the call was ended, I immediately sent my email address along with a nice note reminding them to please send me the statement of what had been discussed. A couple of hours later I received a text, assuring me once again that I would get an email that day. On Friday, after not having yet received the email, nor the bitcoin, I went back to the mall where I Initially deposited my money in the crypto dispensers ATM  and I spoke with the specialty leasing manager. She placed a call to crypto dispensers and was not able to reach anyone, but was forced to leave a message, which is what happens every time you call. She stated that they needed to get back with her for the issue to be solved that day. She also sent an email  stating the same thing.

Clearly I have too much time on my hands haha, I'm wanting to refer them to everyone and their mother and so far I have 5 referrals, 2 that have deposited successfully and 3 that haven't. I've gotten referral credit for one thus far and its my understanding they were still in the process of rolling out the program ( as generous as the sign up bonus itself there are only winners here!) I have faith that it'll work out, and actually Im changing to 5 stars in good faith because idk whats going on behind the scenes but every interaction has been great so thank you thank you.",248,,1,1,1

Take that to the cashier and load anywhere from. $20-$500 as well as a $4.95 processing fee. The money was instantly on my account but took 15 min to clear. Then I purchased my Bitcoin and it sent to my wallet immediately and my wallet verified the deposit and is waiting for the blockchain to finalize it. Super simple and duper easy.

Customer service is non existent. There will be issues and you will not get help!I’ve been using their BTC/LTC machine for a bit because it’s so close to where I live and it was going very well until recently. Three transactions I’ve had problems with. The first was sorted out quickly, I called customer service, a rep fixed the issue and that was that. The second issue came up and I couldn’t get in touch with anyone and it took hours for them to let me know the machine didn’t have LTC, they reloaded and eventually it was sent. This latest issue is enough to just end my business with them. I paid $40 at the machine (2x $20) and I got an email receipt saying I only put in $20. I tried calling them, emailing them, tweeting their account, etc. Nobody answers the customer service number, nobody responds to emails. So I’m out $20 and I guess that’s worth it for them to lose a pretty reliable customer.  24 hours later: still have not heard from anyone.

It genuinely feels like having a portable Bitcoin ATM right in the palm of my hand. If you're looking for a seamless, cost-effective way to delve into the world of cryptocurrency, CDReload is the way to go!",102,,1,1,1

My ex wife was the target of a dental scam in a foreign country. She was coerced into signing a document agreeing to an evaluation, and coerced her into charging what she told was a nominal fee for the evaluation. Instead they charged her around $500 on the Evergreen account and instead of protecting us, this is what Evergreen said...""Good morning Peter,I spoke with (ex-wife)  yesterday as you know, she told me that she found out after her visit that some of the services that dentist did were covered by her dental plan, and she believes she shouldn’t have to pay them. I am sorry she had a bad experience with them, I recommended xxxx file a complaint against the dental office. I understand she may be apprehensive to go to the police, but if you are saying these aren’t her signature this is now a legal matter.(Ex-wife) did mention reviews, reviews are not something we can use in disputes.

My biggest complaint is the slowness of the company in general. I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up.

Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years.

Our first visit was to speak to a loan officer about a car loan.  I called ahead to make sure that there was one available and was told that there were three, so we went right in. We went to let a teller know that we needed to speak to a loan officer, and then sat in the waiting area for 25 minutes while employees walked through the waiting area--no one making eye contact or saying anything. After the 25 minutes, a manager came out and asked if we had been helped, and if we had told a teller that we were there. After that a loan officer (Jorge) helped us draw up papers. Our 2nd visit was to finalize our transaction. I had emailed Jorge the day before to let him know what time we were able to come in. We peeked in to see if Jorge was busy, and he helped us immediately. I would give this visit 5 stars!

I called yesterday noon and the customer representative was trying to tell me to activate my 10th Netspend Card they've sent. I admittedly had responded to a NO! Because many times I've been charge for every card I received and every month ive paid. I'm on I pay monthly outta of my SSI check every month. So that had been including $5.00 a month plus the activation card as well.  U know none of the representatives has ever told that I didn't have to activate every time a card was being sent almost every month. I was fed up to here with them dang cards that I was being charge and token advantage by the customer rep. I've only lost one card that I got replace and yes paid for the activation charge then a coupl3 of months later someone stoled my card outta of my wallet at the grocery store. Yes I report it stolen and stop it. So yes they sent me another card that I had to pay for activation fee. Okay 2 cards were fine to pay, after a month every time I would speak to a Netspend Customer representative they would send me another card sometimes 3 times in a month. I was a dummy activating evey card I received one card would do for all the other cards was getting in the mail because it seem like every representative I would talk to they would send a darn card.I got fed up one day and ask nicely why am I receiving all these cards and all these charges I can't prove because it's in my other Galaxy phone thats broke.i can get printed copies of how many times I payed for these cards but at the same time I switch with all netspend access thinking it was going to be better but my SSI PAYMENTS ARE LATE. WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which  does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done  on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation.  I feel from my rare disease  or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangualIn damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee  below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL. IM STILL TRYING TO MANAGE ON TEXTING with no fingers on the phone.NETSPEND CORPTIAON I DONT GET NO GOV ASSITANCR OR EVEN IF I DIS THATS NONE OF NEtSPEND CORPTION CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE.

You extend a helping hand and then you do not follow through. I have now lost all confidence in Netspend and feel like you do not care about helping your clients. I have called mutilple times and left numerous messages and it is completely silent on your end. I am going to to assume now that Netspend only cares about taking your money and pretending to want to help. What was the point of reaching out if you were not going to follow through. I want a call back immediately or and email response asap. this is literally the worst customer service and a i was hoping it was only from the call center but it is obvious this lack of concern goes all the way to the top of corporate and it is sad. If this is not resolved soon I will be taking this issue as far as I can so that everyone knows that Netspend are theives and to make sure no one ever goes through this again. This is embarrassing for your company and people need to know. If i do not get a response soon i will be forced to reach out to the BBB, my district attorney, my personal lawyer and the local news to report on how your company did not close a card reported stolen and over $900 in charge being taken from my account. and then how a corporate higher up reached out only because of a review I had and then offered to help and then basically ghosted me. I will make sure that it is known that Lea Campos offered to assist me but lied and never truly meant to help me at all . I will let them know I left you multiple emails and multiple voicemail messages and that you NEVR responded back. You offered your direct line and email address and then NEVER INTENDED TO ACTUALLY HELP ME ! but just pretended to offer help when she truly had no intentions of ever following through with her offer to assist. $900 was taken from my account and no one seems to care.

Then a couple days ago the person that had all my information was able to transfer my paycheck that was deposited to my card to their account and now they have started an investigation, but unfortunately I'm the victim, I'm wondering why didn't they interrogate the person that committed the crime just like I was interrogated to try and get my money back the first time. If you requested all that information for proof of residency, they why didn't you do the same to the person on the other end of the phone. Its very unprofessional and nobody suffers but Tracy P.

I have several online accounts at other banks and not one of them takes as long as PNC does. My other banks are either same-day or 48 hours. (2) In order to add a payable-upon-death beneficiary, PNC made me take time off from work to go in person to a branch. I opened the PNC account online, I get my statements online, and I've added my relative as beneficiary to ALL of my other accounts online. Not that hard. Name, Soc. Sec., address of the beneficiary. However, having gone to an office, my relative's name now appears under my own, as if she's a co-owner. She's not.

I only had a $81  check to my name been receiving unemployment since covid began, which left me with $16.00 and Pnc still will not refund my account, that was my water bill money, and each time I call they give me another excuse that it is going to be a 2 week 10-15 day process. Between Amazon and Pnc they are both giving me the run around, Amazon has agreed to Pay the fee but PNC has not even attempted to retrieve me funds eventhough this has been escalated to their disputeand escalation dept, and nothing has been done, my water was shut off yesterday and I dont know what to do in this situation, my next step is to call the United Way and inform them that I need help because Pnc and Amazon allowed my account to get breached because my Granddaughters haven't been able to take a decent bath because our water got shut off because PNC has not refund my money that was stolen from me, during this pandemic I am still going through hardship....Someone from PNC called me yet they still didnt credit my account and Amazon is waiting for the forms for PNC to send them. I just got another job this week working from home will not get paid until next week and I will not allow my direct deposit to go into PNC, and I would advise NO ONE TO ALLOW PNC to be trusted with their hard earned money, If they treat me like this over $65.00 imagine how they will treat you if you have a whole check in your account and something happens its to hard trying to ge back what rightfully yours, Amazon said they tried to get into my account 3-4 times from Jan-Feb yet I was never notified NO ONE Needs A UNTRUSTWORTHY BANK TO HOLD THIER MONEY, AND THEY REFUSED TO PAY MY LATE FEES SINCE MY WATER WAS CUT OFF BECAUSE OF THEIR MISTAKE AND MY LATE FEES ARE $40 AS OF TODAY...DO NOT TRUST PNC BANK TAKE THIS ADVICE FROM A OLDER GUY WHO IS TIRED OF ALLOWING BANKS LIKE PNC TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SENIOR CITIZENS....DONT TRUST PNC WITH YOUR MONEY...",427,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,-1

I was trying to make extra ""principal only"" payments to be able to pay off my car sooner.  The customer service rep advised me to mail a check because processing an extra payment on their portal doesn't allow ""principal only"" options.So, I took her advice and mailed a check, notating on the check ""principal only payment,"" as well as wrapping the check into a regular size piece of paper that also stated in large black sharpie....""PRINCIPAL PAYMENT ONLY"".  I mailed the second check the next month and did the same.I logged onto my account and of course neither payment was processed as Principal Only.I called, because they don't have a chat option of course, to get help fixing it.  The gentleman assured me he would back out the payments and have them applied correctly.  He did this, and then I get a letter in the mail suggesting I stopped making payments on my loan and that I still owed them money.  I ignored those letters, assuming it was automatically generated, idiotic or not, by their system.  I was right.I then mailed a 3rd extra payment in the same manner as before.  Again, not applied correctly.I was so irritated by their incompetence, I scraped together the money and just paid off my car right then and there online. I don't understand how their people are so incompetent and their processes are so antiquated, but I am certain of one thing.  I will never do business with PNC again, and I will tell anyone who will listen about my terrible experience with them.Prior to all of this, I had a name change and was trying to get information about how to change my name on their records.  I was quickly told I would have to go to a local branch to get that completed.  The Rep obviously didn't bother to look at the State where I live.  If she had, she would have noticed that there isn't a PNC Bank in the entire State.  So lazy!  Instead of giving me all the options, she just tells me to go to the local branch.

When I opened an account I went through BBVA and I absolutely loved them. At the time to avoid any kind of fees all I had to do was add a savings account, which I did. Now that it's PNC all that is out the window. You have to either ha for a direct deposit of 500 every month or keep a balance of five hundred dollars in your account. My money gets spent as fast as it comes in, I will never keep that much in my checking and I don't work a job that does direct deposit anymore. I shouldn't have to take out of savings to cover these fees because that would defeat the purpose of having a savings account. I wouldn't complain if I had fees coming out of one account but I have two checkings, one savings and a credit card through with fees that all add up, fees I didn't have before. I beleive that if you were a BBVA customer prior to transitioning to PNC then the contract they signed should follow them. I didn't sign up for PNC, I was forced to merge. I was told I would get a a call from the escalations department regarding the issues in two to three business days. When I never received the call I called PNC back and the customer service rep told me that I already received a call and that the matter was resolved. I told her I absolutely did not receive a call and the problem was not resolved and to say a matter has been resolved just simply because you want to avoid the issue is just plain bad business practice.

I can honestly say that PNC is by far the absolute WORST bank I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with, and I have done business with a lot of banks in my lifetime, as well as worked for a few. Not only do the employees of PNC simply not give a crap, but PNC also seems to have some of the worst systems I have ever seen as well. Going from BBVA to this nightmare bank has been an awful experience. FYI...don't use the debit card lock feature if you might possibly want to unlock the card at night during one of their weekly system updates. Not only does the lock/unlock option disappear for 2-3 hours during these system updates (PNC confirmed this has been a long-known issue by them), leaving you unable to use your debit card if it was locked prior to the update beginning, they also conveniently don't offer any sort of customer support during the overnight hours either. Additionally, I can't even begin to tell you how many issues I have run into trying to utilize their online banking system. In fact, as I write this review, their online banking system is completely down. I cannot for the life of me, fathom why anyone would choose to do business with these clowns. How is this bank still in business? On top of all of this, they also have the audacity to take my once free small business checking account I had with BBVA, and now force me to start paying a monthly fee for it. They have another thing coming if they think I will ever pay a single damn dime for a vastly inferior product than what BBVA offered for free.",305,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

Hmm, I guess nothing!Seriously though, please think long and hard about banking with PNC before opening an account. And if you then decide it's a good idea, think long and hard about it some more.Ok look. For starters, the PNC mobile banking app is terrible. Repeat after me: Ter-ri-ble!!!  It is unexpectedly 'down for maintenance' more than any app I've ever used. I'm sure others will agree. Yep, little to no warning. Just, randomly you will go to make a transaction and upon opening the app - 'Sorry! Closed for maintenance!' Especially at night! So if you are a night owl, beware!The other thing I want to make clear is how undeniably shady they are with how they handle and process your money. Transactions can -and will- be in 'pending' status for days, even weeks! During which time you will make other transactions under the assumption that your available balance is current and reflective of all prior transactions - pending or otherwise. But Noooooo! All of a sudden you will see those pending transactions process and you are left scratching your head looking at a negative account balance that they will happily gift you an additional overdraft fee for.You might be thinking 'Well I can just keep track of my balance with a pencil and a bank log like they did in 1929'. Welllll, kinda. And if you like pencils. And log books. Alot. So here's what's shady....I would transfer money to my CashApp account for example, for gas, to avoid a hold at the pump. My PNC mobile app would then deduct the money from my balance upon transferring it to CashApp, but the transaction would then be in 'pending' status. Sometimes. But not others. And sometimes it may not be finalized for days. I've contacted PNC who, of course deflected responsibility and shifted the blame, citing the excuse that ""it depends on how long it takes their system to communicate with our system."" Good one! Oh, and good luck getting your numbers to match theirs after the dust settles from this days-old transaction. It's so frustrating and confusing and frustrating again that you end up giving up and taking their word that everything perfectly worked out just exactly as it should have no worries needed!  ...Right!I'm thinking like 'well d*mn, what do they mean how long it takes their systems to communicate? Isn't that the whole point of digital online banking? It should be, instantaneous. I mean, we're not hauling the wagons across the frontier anymore folks, what are you actually doing with my money that takes six days digitally to finalize through a computer!?

The first person said it should only take 5-7 days, the second said 7-10 days and the third said 5-7 days or 7-10 days. But if you look on Google it says 5-7 days. So extremely inconsistent answers to the same, simple question. The second and third customer service agent also tried putting the blame on the post office. But it is PNC's fault for not putting tracking on a debit card being sent through the postal service. The postal service has enough issues but sending a small envelope from the corporate office in either cinncinnati or Cleveland where they process the debit card to just outside of Pittsburgh takes up to 10 days? That's entirely not on the postal service, because you can receive a postal package from California in less then 10 days. That is 100% the responsibility of PNC for sending a debit card that way and giving customers inconsistent answers of how long it should take. Absolutely absurd and disgusting for a debit card to take up to 10 days to be delivered. ",208,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

Unfortunately, they just are not set up for international transactions or business.  You can not call them, you can not verify anything because they require text codes which too often you can not receive and thus they will then lock your card.  Too often you will have to sit on hold for at least 30min at $1-$2 per minute just to speak to someone.  Then there are issues at most ATM machines abroad.  If you don't remember to inform them of your travels prior to leaving expect your card to be locked and cycle of trying to reach them repeats. They expect you to inform them of your travel every 30 days therefore you will repeat cycle of chaos trying to reach them. Make your life simple and do not use their cards abroad!! You have been warned!! Lol. I found internationally it's best to go with either more Chase or Bank of America unfortunately.  ",186,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,1,-1

After that, the branch told me they hadn’t followed the proper procedure (apparently they didn’t know the proper procedure) and I would have to snail mail it to the legal department directly. Every person son in every department said “I’m sorry. This must be so frustrating, but there’s nothing I can do in this department.” So what department can help? Nobody knew.

If you have a choice, avoid this bank like the plague. You WILL NOT have a good experience. Customer service is non-existent, their phone system would even have you believe no humans work there. Their app is trash and is literally down more than up. Forget about using a PNC credit card, every other transaction will be declined for fraud. One day I could buy groceries, the next I'd have to use a different card. After many attempts, I finally got a moron to look into it and was told there's nothing that can be done to adjust the fraud algorithm. I had no choice in coming to this dysfunctional mess of a bank, but I did have a choice to leave it.

I’m sure I paid thousands of dollars in fees to PNC in my early 20s when I had a good job but was young and dumb with money. Their overdraft fees are legit and they continuously charge you 35 dollars every day you’re over. It’s seriously scary how much money you can end up giving to PNC just by over drafting a few days before your next paycheck. Not cool and now I am with chime and the difference in money management with them is so much better. Also their saving account has a higher yield percentage than PNC. Obviously PNC operating their many business offices and employees leads to hefty fees for their customers. That is why I switched to chime and I do not miss having an actually bank building to go to. Also closing my accounts with PNC was annoyingly difficult but worth the effort and phone calls.,172,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

They will be gone for 2/3 sometimes 4 days then just reappear. It's almost like they purposely do this to try and get you to overdraft.

I talked to pnc numerous times about this issue and they swore they do not remove transactions. They said the merchant does it??? Kinda odd the same merchants didn't do this when I had BBVA.

The BBVA website and smartphone app were second to none. They worked great and PNC should have used it. PNC's mobile and online banking look and operate like you would expect from 2002, not 2022. For example, when viewing your transactions on their website, you have the option to view only the most recent or ALL OF THEM. Every time I try to view something from outside the most recent, it takes forever to load and locks up my browser. Another example is the way they display your account balances. In addition to the normal Posted Balance and Available Balance, they have a display call Free Balance. The idea is it shows you cash flow based off what you have in the bank compared to any schedule transactions. It doesn't take into account deposits. IT IS USELESS. You can't turn it off and its the first thing you see on the smartphone app.  Today I had a small panic when logged in and the website showed a balance of $1000 in my account. When I opened the mobile app it only showed a balance of $23.58. The app shows the Free Balance by default and the site shows the Posted/Available. Want to view your account and routing number? Well, AFTER you have logged in and are looking at your account, you then have to navigate through other pages and then submit a request where they send you a code to get to view your information. Is it for security concerns that someone might steal your info?  This makes no sense as you are already logged in and are able to transfer funds and make payments without the additional steps. The data migration from BBVA to PNC did not go smoothly. My accounts, my parents', and several of my friends have all had issues. We're talking getting locked out of personal and large business accounts and having other family members' names on the wrong accounts. I tried to order some checks from a branch only to find out 3 weeks later the order was never submitted.

They have it set up instead to call my business landline, which is currently on my desk 4,200 miles away. I contacted them to find out if I can change it. They won't send email (other banks will) and they said they could have it call my international number, but could not send text messages to it. This was the first call. I was told to message the business unit to have this set up. Half an hour chat session only to be told to call the international customer disservice number again. Two more calls - both times disconnected when the rep didnt' know how to complete a call transfer. Fourth call, I get through and the rep tells me they can set it up, places me on hold for half an hour (cha ching! with international call charges) only to finally get back on the line and say that they cannot do this right now.

I call today and she tells me that ""while PNC tries not to disconnect customers, it is a phone system after all..."" Yeah, and they can't wait on the line until the receiving department answers to make sure the call isn't dropped. Blaming technology is not an excuse for incompetence and customer disservice.Anyway, the result of today's call (number 5 international call) was nothing except the customer disservice rep would ""document"" my concerns.

Already they've lost my trust.i sincerely hope that you do not EVER need to contact PNC's customer service department!  Not only did they provide me with one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but they apparently do not have a mechanism in place to file a complaint!  Two different reps told that they were going to file a complaint “on (my) behalf”, and that someone should call me within 2-3 business days.  That was 8 days ago. Still no call. When I directly asked the 2nd rep how I could file my OWN complaint on my OWN behalf, she literally told me to go complain on Twitter!  TWITTER?!?!  Really??All I wanted to know was if a specific check had cleared that I wrote back about 6 months ago. They only have the last 90 days of statements from BBVA/Compass loaded to the PNC website, and the BBVA website is shut down.I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you that it took over 6 1/2 hours to get an answer.I used the chat feature on their website to message my question at 2:15 pm. They finally responded at 5:33 pm, then kept me on the chat line until 8:16 pm asking the same questions over and over, telling me they were getting a manager, then that the manager wasn’t coming, that they didn’t have access to that, then that they would fax it or mail it, but couldn’t give me online access, then that they couldn’t even do that, and I would have to go into a branch etc, etc,etc….Finally she suggested that I call their toll free number. After almost 3 hours of chatting she basically told me that I was SOL, but that she was “filing a complaint on my behalf”! I did call their toll free number and the woman who answered was very helpful and apologetic, accessed my statements from April-September and answered my question.  She also said she was filing a complaint on my behalf, which I appreciate, but she’s the one who then told me to go on Twitter to file my own complaint! We got off the phone at 8:47 pm.That’s 2:15 - 8:47 pm total time, and 5:33 - 8:46 pm that required my active participation such that I was not able to do anything else.UNACCEPTABLE!!Both reps very polite, but their sheer incompetence has me planning moving my business account to another bank after almost 20 years!

I made it very clear during the call that it was an ACH payment, and I spoke to more than one rep over the course of 2-3 days to make absolutely certain that what I was told was fact. They all verified what the first agent had told me. Well it turns out that it was not true. I also called on Monday 7/10/2023 to ask if the transaction would still be paid if all funds were not available or if it would be returned and was assured that all that would happen is that I would incur an NSF fee, which I was fine with. It turns out that was also untrue, since I woke up to an email today notifying me that there was a ""decision"" on my account that I needed to address. I logged in and saw that I had until 2pm est. time today to have the funds available, or the payment would be reversed, which would have cancelled my insurance. I do not hold PNC responsible for me not having the funds available, nor do I hold them responsible for upholding their policy. What I DO hold them responsible for is the misinformation that was spread by their representatives. It would be one thing if I was misinformed by ONE rep, but I spoke to several people who ALL misinformed me during my calls with them. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the reps, or the bank itself. The fact that more than one of their employees gave false information indicates to me that this is a widespread issue within that bank's culture and I am seriously reconsidering my relationship with them.

They cancelled my card against my wishes, never told me, didnt bother to replace the card and then want to change me $25 to make up for it.

The investment officer at branch bank in Hurst Texas on Bedford Euless rd was Eddie Gassoway. I had couple of meetings with him about investing $18,000, and expressed to him him that I wanted something safe that would be guaranteed to lose no value, but make me a little over a ten year period. I was just beginning to draw SSA benefits and trying to retire from self employment of 50 years. Eddie talked me into a market indexed CD that at minimum would return me $23,000 at end of ten years. Not good now, but acceptable then. When I got my first six month statement value of CD had dropped to around $17,000, so I went in to talk over with Eddie and he assured me that it just appeared that way, but there had actually been no drop in value. Long story short it's six years later, value of CD is now around $14,000. When I went in about six months ago they told me no worry at end of ten years I would still have my $18,000. I responded that I could have left under mattress for ten years and still had $18,000. At this point no officer at this band will even discuss the investment with me but they do give me an 800 # that I can call. Banked at this branch since 1999 since they were Guarantee, and this is the customer service u get from them. Just closed out personal and business checking accounts on 5/7/24.

If you got screwed anywhere and need to do a chargeback, don’t even try, because you will be rejected. I made a purchase at convenience store and the card was declined 3 times fir unknown reason, however the charges got posted 3 days later, PNC refused to grand a chargeback request and I lost 100$. Another example, I made a purchase online and never received my order (no shipment 3 weeks after the purchase), so I tried to get a refund from vendor but my request was ghosted. I disputed transaction with PNC and again was rejected. Within 9 years I made a chargebacks 3 times and all times no help from PNC. Lastly, for me the last straw was when I found out that my account is closed by PNC. I tried to find out the reason and customer support agent told me they dont see the reason because it was handled by a different department, so representative told me to stop by to local Pnc branch. In the branch I was assisted by some very pompous and rude manager who made some stupid jokes that made me extremely uncomfortable. Anyway, this manager didn’t provide me with any information regarding why my account was closed other than saying that pnc tried to contact me prior this and that I didn’t respond, however this is not true, I never received any phone calls or letters from them. In addition he didn’t provide me with an answer why account was actually closed, because it was not shown in the system.

Being 16 years old, they attempted to charge me over $170, but were ""nice"" enough to ""waive"" half of the fees. I did not receive any alerts.About 2 years ago, I opened a credit card with my mom. It was joint so that I was able to get a credit score off of it. I had an authorized transactions from at least an hour away from me. They were for various gas stations and a different areas that are nowhere close to where I live. The transactions were also on the same day when it was not possible for me to go for one place to another, especially when I work. When I called them, they jumped me from person to person to person and I was on hold for an hour. The person I talked to accused my husband of using my credit card and stealing from me. Why would my husband steal from me? He could just tell me or ask. The lady on the phone tried to argue with me and tell me that they are my transactions for they were his transactions, or even my mother-in-law stole my card.

Hackers most certainly can! Absolutely! Instead of receiving help, I and my husband get accused of fraud. How ridiculous! I have never met any company that's willing to do that to their customers, especially when I've been with them for almost 7 years now. Their alerts lag. I never received emails in time. I get an overdraft email when my account has money actually in it. Money doesn't get taken out of my bank account until days later, which makes me think I have more money than what I actually have. Honestly, sometimes I feel like they take my money because it goes in mysterious ways. When I am overdraft, they will tell me I have a negative balance at 2:00 a.m. . Who's up that early? Who's going to check their bank account? Then they tell you if you don't put your balance above zero in 12 hours or less, they'll start charging you at least $30. It doesn't necessarily make sense to charge someone money when they don't have money at all, doesn't it? Get your act together. Don't trust PNC. I don't trust PNC. They're a scam.

They said the due date was 6pm on the due date for automated system phone payments (something no other credit card does), but midnight for online payments. I made my payment at 7pm with the automated system, which told me my payment was processed and on time. But even the mangers at PNC CC services refused to wave the late fee for a payment made on time. They clearly don't value their good customers. Expect lots of empty lip service about how they value your business but actions indicating they really don't. Needless to say I cancelled my PNC credit card after the conversation with managers today, and will take all my money out of PNC bank once I have made other arrangements. The bank has been pulling all its benefits, and adding lots of fees.

In the end, he whined like a 5-year-old who needed a nap; blaming me for his incompetence, instead of finding an alternate solution. He hung up in a huff.  I do not react well to feigned incompetence. Failure to keep one's word is worse.  But, if you cannot row the boat, let go of the oars. This bank is quite incompetent and they will let you down at just the right time.",271,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

I was a BBVA customer and since PNC took over I have not had a reason to speak with anyone. I called online banking and was transferred  to customer service. The young woman I was talking with about enrolling in online banking was rude. I did not have a pin for my card I had had the account for 10 years but had never used the pin. Also,  I did not have an ID pin given to me when I setup the account because I never setup an account with PNC. I answered many questions to show that the account that I wanted to enroll in online banking was mine. I was eventually informed that I would need one of those pins to enroll in online banking. However, the customer  service persons voice was getting louder and had a negative tone. She could have just said initially "" I'm sorry but I will not be able to enroll you in online banking today the card pin is required. I can send you one in the mail which you should receive in 3-5 days. She sounded annoyed that I did not have a card pin, did not have an ID pin and that I was not aware of those facts. She had asked earlier on if I wanted a pin and I said no I just want to enroll in online banking. I did not know that I had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I have only ever used a card pin for cash withdrawals which I have not done in the last 25 years. Also, I have had many online banking accounts and if you can provide enough information customer service has always been able to help.  I have never had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I was already enrolled in online banking through BBVA and the account was about 9-10 years old. So maybe using a pin is a good idea, but pardon me for not knowing that  it was required. I have been asked many questions over the years but never have I had to have a card pin. When I told the customer  service agent that she had an unpleasant attitude she was even more unpleasant. I can only imagine my distress if had I been calling about a serious banking concern.

After an hour of battling with them, they finally told me all branches are closed. Why would PNC treat their customers that way? It's inhumane!! Couldn't they just say that the branches are closed right away? Why do they have the customer who is already aggravated and tired from trying to log in their PNC website or app go through this excruciating process only to find out that they are closed? Why do they despite their customers? I was thinking of opening a checking account with them. Now I am 100% sure that I will NEVER EVER open an account with a company that despises their customers.

Familiar with most employees on a first-name basis and have only praise for management.Then I moved to Port Saint Lucie FL, Tradition 55+ community. Punched up PNC Bank in FSD Tesla #3 and was driven to front door of an office with PNC logo on front, ten minutes away. Waled in greeted by large empty room, excepting a folding table and chair. A woman appeared from around a wall. Inquired about cashing y VA disability check and she replied, ""we have no cash here, only sell securities, the branch is on Gatlin Blvd.""I drove 3.5 miles to the branch far away from the PSL action, the fifth fastest growing city in the USA, on a Saturday morning, only to find a long line extending out the front door. After a long wait the teller says, ""I can't cash this check. Your account has not been open for a year. I have had a steady checking account for five years but six months prior closed it and opened a joint account with my daughter for estate planning.I asked to speak with the manager and a woman from the drive up window responded. She suggested the teller deposit the check and then withdraw the amount of the check and give me cash. This required the teller filing out both deposit and withdrawal slips. The line out the door grows longer and a man next in line behind me becomes, understandably, becomes vociferous. Eventulall I get the cash an leave having to walk past folks in line giving me a jaundiced eye.So I wrote the PNC CEO a letter outlying the experience. A week or so later, now a month later on a Thursday got call from the branch manager that I missed as on another important call. I returned her call within five minutes and was greeted with a voice message identifying her name. I called again on Friday, then Monday...leaving messages. Then drove to the branch and was told she was not in so wrote my name and phone number on a note, asking her to call me and asked the teller to give it to her. I also called the useless PNC ofice across from Target in Traition and explained the branch manager was not returning my calls and gave a man my phone number asking him to contact the branch manager and have her call me.Still waiting!",413,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,1

This made it so that the employees at the local branch were unable to help me as I began to have issues. Along the way there was a large reserve attached to my account ( which I was told once I met the amount I would get my money deposited into my account) I was lied to several times by both the rep and the PNC Clover rep. I purchased a Clover Flex through the bank thinking if I left PNC I could use with another bank only to find out from Clover that the Flex I purchased can only be used at PNC.

I was going to get another $50 bonus, once I started a Savings account, within six months. I also held a BBVA Compass VISA credit card, with $2000 limit. After six months, PNC acquired BBVA and informed me my Savings account did not meet the minimum balance requirements for bonus eligibility, a policy I never knew existed. PNC instructed me to destroy my existing credit card, promising a PNC credit card would replace it. Despite me asking several times about my new credit card, I was passed off to many Customer Service representatives who knew nothing, eventually I got hung up on and the new card never arrived. I still held remaining credit on the Visa card, but was unable to continue using it because I had nothing to swipe, for new purchases. I never missed payments and yet, PNC raised my existing VISA card APR from 24.99% to a whopping 31.99%, which I find is Usurious highway robbery. When I learned PNC was shutting down certain branches I realized the BBVA takeover forced them to cut costs and I was dealing with just another nickel and dime, ruthless Commercial Bank. I was finally told I needed to pay off my remaining BBVA balance first, then re-apply for a PNC Visa credit card. However, at those outrageous interest rates - I recently closed all PNC accounts and switched to a Credit Union. The staggering amount of negative reviews is no anomaly - PNC has resorted to using deceptive practices and evasion of truth, to perpetuate its existence. BBVA was a great bank, but PNC tarnished their stellar reputation, by being the polar opposite of BBVA. My best recommendation, is run far away from PNC.",306,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,-1

When I do talk with them all I hear is the problem is being reviewed.  I will return to Thailand soon and you can imagine the problem of trying to solve this from there.

That refund was deposited in my account on 12-31-20 the very next day and that was it, I heard nothing more and assumed everything was taken care of.2-26-21 (2 months) later I wake up to a provisional credit reversal of 2 separate charges.$100$600I naturally call the back of my visa card like I did in December thinking I am experiencing more Fraud not knowing what “provisional credit reversal means”.I speak to Daniel who was absolutely no help so I asked if I could speak to a manager. Daniel stated he can have a manager call me back in 24 - 48 hours. I said that actually isn’t going to work for me and my situation, I would like to speak to a manager now. I was put on hold for roughly 20 minutes (I understand not upset about that, usually normal) then Daniel comes back on the line and introduces me to Casey the customer service manager of PNC.I expressed to Casey why I am confused. I stated. . .“I don’t understand why I have $600 of “provisional credit reversal” charges and what does that mean and why?Casey explained that back in December on 12-30 I reported Fraud in the amount of $600. Casey said on the 12-31 PNC deposited a credit of $600 into my account (Fraud Protection). Then Casey said the confusion is because the same day 12-30 when I called about the Fraud the Tatoo Parlor re-deposited $600 into my account. That is where I get confused and something sounds fishy at this point. So now it looks/ seems I got my Fraud money back from the Tatoo Parlor for $600 dollars on 12-30 and I got $600 deposited into my account on 12-31 by PNC and that equals $1,200.My question for Casey at this point in the conversation...1. Why would the tattoo parlor deposit A Fraud transaction back into my account?2. If my account was being investigated/ The Fraud department opened my case on 12-30 why did they not catch the Tatoo parlor deposit $600 into my account on 12-30?3. If it did in fact show I was credited back $600 why did PNC deposit another $600 into my account the very next day 12-31?4. Also why 2 months later is PNC taking $600 out of my account? That is not in my budget for February or any months to be exact.5. I said I was/ am under the impression my account was being reviewed because of Fraud back in December but why 2 months later is PNC catching this so called Tattoo parlor deposit?Casey told me I am going around in circles and there is nothing he can do except he will contact the rep who helped me in December and use this as a training service. Casey basically in my opinion stated our Fraud Department should of caught that back in December but unfortunately did not. I will be switching banks and advising anyone one and everyone to be your own advocate. Bank at PNC at your own risk in my opinion and watch out for Casey, he is just another banker guy who wants to collect a paycheck, which I am personally not interested in banking at a bank that I don’t feel safely and timely assists with my money.",724,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

Immediately they began playing games making me create a legal paper trail with both banks to prove the bank's mistakes. This mistake went all the way to the President's office and stopped. Canceled due to the length of time. After I dropped my larger balance to a minimum amount. Even though I have never been late on any payments - 2 expensive cars. A $30,000 line of credit and $20,000 lines of credit on each credit card dropped my line of credit resulting in other cc to drop my lines of credit for no reason.

Once one officer told me confidently that my revised doc is all good, but it turned to be rejected by underwriting team again. 3) Unmotivated loan officer. PNC takes zero initiative to address customer's issues. It is said that other lenders would simply solicit appropriate documents from HOA, banks, insurance agencies, etc. This bank considers these are your job. On top of that, they don't know what documents their underwriting team are looking for. Other than copy-and-paste, their loan officers know nothing.4) Mismanaged customer service phone line. I called during the line's normal business hour, about one hour until close. The line did forward my call to an operator, it turned out nobody answered the phone for 5 minutes until I hang up.

I should have switched banks as soon as they locked my debit card after my first purchase because it was for a server rental... in Canada (OVH, which is the world's 3rd largest hosting company). Also, arbitrary $5000 limit on daily debit card spend, that's money that I've deposited into my account. I order checks and it bounces not because of insufficient funds but ""they don't have my signature"". Had to upgrade my account, didn't provide a signature (since BBVA had it ffs) and suddenly it works! Can't send wire transfers, was told to go to a branch... 2 states away. Incoming wires randomly a day late. Almost every single international purchase, even digital, gets my card locked. When I spoke to someone over a purchase under $500 for a yearly subscription in HK, was told that ""HK is the source of a lot of scams suddenly"", yes, because Chinese New Year was 2 weeks ago and it's not a one day event and fraud is a business and being a bank that should be obvious (agent at least was apologetic and we connected over the cultural incompetency that he acknowledged, although it's weird to explain both how fraud and holidays work as a crim defense attorney to a bank agent in charge of fraud, ostensibly). To up my debit spend limit I had to keep $5k in the account, so now my limit is $10k but I still get randomly limited for purchases well under. At this point I keep money in brokerage/crypto because my bank treats my money like an interest-free loan. Also, their data transition from BBVA marked me as a status that had I actually declare would be a felony and I had to call and they couldn't promise on the phone to rectify it. At least on the record I made sure that it was their error because the judicial system is already unfair and crazy coercive and I know my rights as it's my job. Asked how I can get access to wire money domestically and after 3 escalations the agent said ""it's random,  we don't know if you'll get the ability"". I don't believe that at all. 2nd worst bank I've used (worst is current in bankruptcy and they comingled customer money), on par with Chime which was a fake bank and almost killed me with their lie (bought furniture and maxed out my 'spending account' that is hard limited at 2.5k, it was 110 and I'm in vegas in a parking lot hoping someone would give me a ride). At least now I can buy gift cards with crypto because the bank is utterly unreliable. I got locked for buying baseball cards. I mean, it wasn't even fancy, it was literally a retail box from the official website. Can't tell if troll or have the worst fraud department because it didn't detect an actual fraudulent transaction (at a sportsbook that didn't have a license here in NV so I can't sign up and they geofence). At least the bankrupt bank is trying to make whole since I can follow the docket and proceedings. God knows what's going on with this bank. I don't want a loan, or credit, or anything. I just need a non-prepaid debit that allows me to wire and ACH my own money. Oh, and I also don't believe you can't whitelist a customer who has recurring overseas subscriptions at large companies. Paypal, which is not a bank and tried to steal my money, can do that. And I seriously don't need a loan, or CC, really. Debt isn't for everyone, deal with it.

I wanted an assurance that they'd honor my next check when I sent another one to the tax collector, and I asked them to cover the $30 fee I incurred because of it. I didn't ask for anything else.

DO NOT USE PNC BANK UNLESS YOU LIKE THEM GIVIBG YOUR MONEY AWAY !!! This is the worst bank and the dumbest people work here .  They lie about transactions …. I paid a company and the money came out of my account.  But the company I paid said they declined the payment .  Which seems totally impossible because I moved money to the account just to pay a bill and to pay for services in advance because they gave me a discount.   Then the company called and said that they did release the money to them but then called me back shortly four hours later to let me know that they had reversed the charges and taking the money back from them.   But the money was still gone from my account……… PNC gave me the runaround saying that I needed to dispute the charge so that they could get the money back which they already had it back.  I talked to five or six different people and every single person gave me a different excuse and a different solution.   The money was gone from my account for over six weeks and never paid to the company that I was trying to pay.    It took about 20 hours worth of calls to finally get someone that had the money put back in my account.   Then two weeks later the money was taken out again which overdrafted my account and cost me to incur many fees…..   I even spoke to the company that they were supposed to pay and still to this day they’ve never received one penny I have since then canceled service with them and signed up with someone else.    I spoke to someone and their executive offices today and they proceeded to tell me that the money was given to the other company but we called the other company yesterday on three-way with PNC and they told him at that time that still to this day they don’t have the money from them and I’ve close the account so I no longer need to pay them.   Now I see online that PNC is giving away $400 to new customers…… and because I’m an existing customer they’re not worried about it they don’t care they don’t care that they’ve caused me to have fees and I’m probably gonna be evicted because they have kept my money and I wasn’t able to pay my rent.  Do you think these people care that they’re going to cause me to be evicted of course not !!   So unless you like your money being taken from you at any time for whatever they feel like then you should bank here but if you’d like to keep your money and pay your own bills go somewheres else.   My husband is disabled and unable to work so the little bit of money that we get plus my pay it’s just enough for us to pay our bills.   I’m sick of talking to these line people that work there they keep on pretending like the company has the money that they gave it to them and that’s a straight out lie I know this other company is trustworthy because I used to work there and that’s why it’s so embarrassing to me that this even happened,560,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,-1

I’ve been with this bank for years now and I honestly don’t know why because my family and I have had nothing but problems and gone into financial issues because of them. I’ve had one helpful lady who spoke clear English in all the countless times I’ve called to speak to their customer service. They have other nice people that work there but I don’t know if they realize I just nod along to things they say because I can’t understand them. I think they do it that way to lower the number of calls made to their CS dept. but it would still be nice to not have to be on the phone for an hour because I need everything repeated. But even after calling them three times over the last two weeks, I still don’t have a debit card. They told me it would arrive in the mail earlier this week, and it’s now the weekend and I was told by another PNC member just this morning that the order for my new debit card is nonexistent. I’ve been without a means to pay for anything for like three weeks now. The money in my old checking account was hacked into and stolen. I know better than to use debit cards now, but having one just in case would be nice. I was told my social security number is wrong by several PNC members. I can’t send money through Zelle either right now because my ATM pin does not work. I can’t use my bank account in Venmo because I have no means of verifying my account. And of course banks are only open like 3 days a year so I have to wait another while before going in for more help. I actually just got a Discover card for the time being so I can afford to eat and have a roof over my head. Oh and don’t get me started on PNC randomly cancelling access to all my accounts for no reason. That’s a fun one. And the worst part is, this happens ALL the time.

I have been a customer of PNC and its legacy banks for nearly 50 years.  I started with Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania in1974 as a USAF cadet in Colorado Springs.  The bank took a risk on me and gave me a car loan which I paid back.  Up until now, I have enjoyed and valued the remote relationship I have maintained with PNC Bank over this five decade period of time.  I lived overseas twice during my career and moved all around the US. I never once set foot inside a PNC bank simply because there was never one near where I lived. I now live in Lynn Haven Florida.  There is no local PNC Branch in Lynn Haven.  The nearest PNC Branch is in Destin Florida.I will present the two reasons I am terminating my 50 year relationship with PNC Bank.  The first matter concerns PNC’s current policy with respect to opening a CD.  In February of this year I decided to investigate CD Rates and came to the conclusion it was time to take some money from my checking account and move it into a CD.  I quickly learned that this needed to be done in person at a PNC branch.  I decided to try and learn why this was the case since in the past and during COVID it was possible to do this over the phone.  My inquiry comprised multiple calls to 800-233-4171, multiple conversations with consultants in the sales department, one person in Birmingham Al to whom my complaint had been elevated, two branch managers, and finally a Vice President for Executive Client Relations in Michigan.  I spent the better part of two weeks investigating this and to try to find a work around.  The conversations with the two branch managers are worth noting. One was in Destin Florida. It became clear that, in her case, my problem was not her problem.  She very quickly routed me back to customer service stating the over the phone “system” was down. A second branch manager in the Tampa area took ownership of my problem and proposed an “out of the box” solution.  His approach was to offer me a special saving account rate commensurate with current CD rates (say in the 3.5% to 4% range).  I complement this individual since he, unlike his Destin counterpart, demonstrated he was willing to work the issue. I will also say that two sales consultants, who were willing to speak candidly, did admit that they too were frustrated with this situation. One admitted sales was how she made her living and if she could not sell a product it hurt where it counts - in her pocket book. At several junctures I asked the PNC employees I spoke with how they would handle a US service member deployed overseas. One sales consultant triumphantly responded that he or she would have to fly back to the states to open a CD!! That is outrageous!! I am suspicious of the statement that PNC is “working on the system” to allow an over the phone opening of a CD.  They have been working on it for several months – at least since the first of this year. -A large bank such as PNC should have a very flexible and agile IT department and any IT “fixes” should be rolled out quickly. I believe the policy is in response to some nefarious incident.  Most institutions react to bad news situations by quickly shutting down the “thing” where the problem occurred.  The most frustrating aspect to this matter is no one knows why this policy was put in place and if or when it will be changed.  For whatever reason, the information is being tightly controlled.I also don’t believe this policy came from the top. I want to believe the CEO – Mr. William Demchak – did not direct this and that he is probably not even aware of this issue.My second reason for leaving is I find PNC’s interest rates on deposit accounts to be predatory in nature.  I cite the example of my checking account which currently pays .01%.  PNC Customer Service reps cite this as the ""industry standard.""  The new bank to which I am moving pays 25 times that amount on a checking account.  When I pointed this out to one PNC sales rep, I was lectured that checking accounts are not intended to be investment vehicles. Of course they are not!   Meanwhile PNC is busy loaning funds I have deposited and paying an insulting rate of .01%.  The PNC sales reps I spoke with are too young to know that in the past PNC did pay higher rates on checking deposits. I checked again yesterday ( 6 April) by calling customer service.  The phone system for opening a CD is still down.  This makes no sense. I no longer recommend PNC. When I read the reviews from this site (around 700!) it all rings true.The bank has lost the bubble on customer service. Too big and too cumbersome.  Take your money out of PNC Bank and run away as fast as you can. Randall J",865,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,1

Imagine if you will a debit card especially designed for direct deposit for government checks like social security. And that very same said organization transferring funds to PNC and in the same 24 hours retracting them. I wrestled with Comerica long enough to realize They will NOT budge. I did everything I could do instructionally to gain access to my PNC account and all the documents they needed to perform a transfer. 3-4 times I tried 3-4 times the money came back. I contacted PNC by phone , my biggest nightmare, and got from a very squeeky voice, ""You might try contacting your other bank (Comerica), so I gave up as I do with all customer service calls with a human.

I have never had business with this company in my life and PNC attempted to blame me for the purchase.  I proved them wrong and got my money back.  If you were a investigator would you suspect insider threat since most of the customer service is foreign with access to our accounts ?  I had an account with this company since 1995.  I recently closed my account and I do not recommend using PNC Bank,153,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

Buggy web site, a broken account recovery process, account reps that were consistently unable to get me access... even their automated voice prompts are awful, with a synthesized voice that sounds like it came from the 80s.After a recent (and unsuccessful) call attempting to have them to cancel my account and send me my funds, I tried to use their own automated survey system to give them feedback, but the survey links quickly expire.

One person yesterday was extremely helpful, but we could go no further as a HELOC close date had not been entered yet.

They asked her to confirm the amount of any withdrawal or deposit into her checking account, and she did not understand what they were asking.  They did not make her do this the day before, so we didn't prepare any statements to be on hand. I tried to explain and they told me that no one was supposed to be on ""the other line.""

I have been a PNC customer for over 30 years and my father longer than that.  Around August 2023, I entered the Edgewood Town Center branch to have the POA documents copied.  I hand delivered the original POA to the branch manager.  He made a copy of the POA documents and forward them to legal team for review.  Around October 2023 I returned to the Edgewood Town Center Branch and presented Social Security documents authorizing me as the legal representative of my father's checking account.  The branch manager made copies of this document and forward them to the legal team for review. On December 22, 2023, I went to the Penn Hills branch to get a cashier's check out of my father's account to pay his upcoming rent.  Cashier informed me that my name doesn't appear in their system as POA and could not release any funds.  She directed me to the front desk for assistance.  The Penn Hills branch manager was so kind as to assist me in calling the Edgewood Town Center branch to investigate this matter further.  I also made a phone call to the Edgewood Town Center branch.  I spoke to the customer service representative and left a message for the branch manager to return my call.  Later that day, the branch manager returned my call and asked me what was the issue.  I asked him what happened to my father's legal documents I presented to him to forward to the legal team.  He responded that there wasn't any POA documents in his file and no alerts in the system.  I reminded the branch manager that I gave him those documents to copy and forward to the legal team.  He denied ever seeing any POA documents AND added that I couldn't prove that I was ever in the office for services. We went back and forward arguing this matter.   At this point, I asked for his supervisor's name and office address.  He only gave me his supervisors name but refuse to give me the address of his supervisor's office location. He stated that his supervisor is always on the road.  I informed the branch manager that I would be filing a complaint against him for losing legal documents and ended the call very angry and frustrated.  After filing my complaints, I received a call from the PNC Executive team on December 27, 2023.   The team informed me that they DID receive my POA documents.  However, a page was missing.  The executive team stated that they had notified the branch manager in September 2023 to contact me of this missing page.  I informed the executive team that I had also given the branch manager the social security documents to be forwarded the legal team for review.  The executive team is still searching for those.  At the end of our conversation, the Executive team gave me their direct contact information to forward the missing page and soc security documents for processing.   They also apologized for the inconvenience.   I was very satisfied of the quick response and how professional they handled this matter.   The Executive Team made no excuses.  Instead, they listened intently and was compassionate regarding my concerns.In conclusion:  This branch manager tried to control the customer by attempting to twist my sense of reality implying that I never stepped foot in that branch office for any type of services.  Is this gaslighting?  This branch manager is dishonest and incompetent.",587,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,0

What started out as a checking account in a customer-friendly local bank eventually became an unimportant account to a huge corporate-friendly mega-bank with oppressive fees and marginal customer service to their private citizen account holders.  Need your missing debit card  replaced?  No problem, as long as you don’t mind a $7 fee and a 7 day wait. Lots of other banks, large and small, will send a replacement card overnight or 2nd day delivery free of charge.  Want a free checking account?  PNC has one, as long as you’re ok with not touching the $500 minimum balance. Other banks just want a monthly deposit with no minimum balance.  Want free checks?  Hey, no worries!  But only if you choose one of their top of the line accounts with a $25 monthly fee. Other banks, well…. you might see the pattern here. I could go on, but like I started out saying, I’m an old geezer. If it weren’t such a tedious process, I’d switch to another bank or a credit union. Maybe I will.

As she prepared my check, a question popped in my head. When she returned I asked her. If the card numbers were reported stolen, what could one do with that information anyway? ""A lot!"" She replied. Then she proceeded to give me Stealing a Credit Card 101. Yup, she spoke to me for 10 more minutes on what I could do with someone's reported stolen credit card numbers!

We are an established African American middle/working class couple with good credit and low debt. Our experience with PNC from start to finish was an EXTREME stressful experience! A process that should have taken 30 days to finish ended up taking over 90 days because PNC was so sloppy and extremely untimely in processing our application. Our assigned representative was always out of the office and very difficult to contact; Our paperwork/contract was riddled with errors and each time one was discovered, it took weeks for PNC to correct; Repeated request for information that should had be cleared early in the application process; And finally, it took 2 scheduled closing dates where we had to arrange time away from work and other obligations to attend. After closing on that 2nd., scheduled closing date, past 90 days, when we got our first bill, we discovered one of the errors that was ""supposed"" to be corrected, and we signed off on as a corrected item, was not corrected. We got so many apologies from PNC representatives along the way and afterward; Including bank manager Ingra Gelishvilli, Roxoboro Rd location in Durham NC, suggesting and promising to submit a request to her manager for approval for a gift/token to us as a result of our inconvenience and PNC's neglect. She lied! We made several phone calls and left messages attempting to contact her to make good on her commitment... No response.  Her choice was to ignore us. And to this day, we have heard nothing from Ingra. It is most offensive because this particular PNC representative (Ingra) pretended to be so on our side… She is not deserving of trustworthy!  It is sad that we as Americans have such distrust in the very institutions that should have a reasonable loyalty to its customers. That trust does not exist anymore.

Somebody stole the account info from her PNC Debit Card and is buying airline tickets, monthly subscriptions, and so on. Note that I am named on the account to inherit upon her death. We went into the PNC branch near her to sign papers on that, showing them the Durable Power of Attorney she had granted me when we did so. This should at least show these people that I am not just some random bozo walking in off the street to mess with some random person's account. Today I called their fraud hotline and told them that any charge on the debit card other than ATM withdrawals is fraudulent; she never uses this debit card except for that purpose. The Indian I spoke to couldn't just mark all debit purchases as fraudulent. I had to go through each one I wanted to mark so. This was difficult because this fraud expert basically doesn't bloody speak English. Not that I mind, you have a right to speak your own language, but if you're doing English Language customer service I would have expected that ability to speak English might have been a job requirement. Apparently saving a few cents a day was more important.Not reassured, I called Mom's local branch and asked them if the purchases had been challenged. They said no, but they would try to do so. Again, I read them the list of purchases because they can't just mark all debit card purchases as fraudulent from their end. Oh no no no, I have to somehow get a list of all of them and enter them from MY end, they can't be troubled to find a list on their servers and click it once.I wanted to cancel Mom's debit card and get a new one for her. They couldn't do it, but no problem, they said; I have a PNC branch in my town, all I have to do is go in and show them ID. They'll take care of it right away.So I did. I went to MY local PNC branch. Where they refused to tell me anything about the account that my name is on, based on the fact that I did not have in my possession an original copy of my Durable Power of Attorney document. They wouldn't tell me whether ANY of the fraudulent charges (or any new ones that have come in since) had been challenged. Or if the old debit card had been disabled. Nothing. Not one bloody thing. And my name was right on the bank statement they were looking at.But no problem. All I have to do is drive seven hours to get Mom to fill out a new form and sign it. Then I can bring that back up here and they will deign to do something to combat the ongoing fraud... assuming it doesn't interrupt their weekly staff meeting.

I am Syrian, we have no bank accounts back home. The international laws prohibit us from making an account. I am a physician persuing training in the US. I trained there for 4 months and went back home. While there, PNC agreed to open an account for me. They said even if you went abroad, we wouldn’t close the account. I trusted them and placed my entire networth with them, because these were savings made to support my medical residency application in the US and I needed access to an online payment platform . I have access to no other funds anywhere. Just when I needed the money, a message from my prior roommate in the US saying that they had sent mail stating that they were closing the account. Decision is final. I rush to open my PNC app just to find that there’s no way for the money out. I try on transfers, Zelle, I tried everything, they even stopped my debit card. I was not in the US to receive a check. They directed my calls to a number that didn’t have a person on it. They said I had to leave a voicemail and that no callback was guaranteed. Luckily, customer service was willing to re-open my access to the mobile banking app but of course, all activity was limited , I kept trying until I was able to send the money via PayPal account previously linked to the bank. It was very very risky since that people account was not verified by my identity and if they tried to verify my identity and found that I’m Syrian, they wouldn’t have accepted that. They would’ve kept all the money, but thank God that went smoothly.

We started the process on 7/15/2022 and finally decided to use a different lender on 9/08/2022. The reason is because PNC used a drive by appraiser that undervalued our property by at least 115k. When we brought this to PNC’s attention and provided receipts and documentation, it was like pulling teeth to have them set up a new appraisal. When they finally did, it was the same appraisal company, but this time they came into our house. Two weeks later the new appraisal came in 20k less than their 1st appraisal. THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE SINCE WE HAD JUST INVESTED 120k. PNC did not want to loan us what we were requesting so we reached out to another lender, and we are already set to close on 9/22/22. The new lenders appraisal came in at 115k over what PNC had. They were so disturbed by the other appraisal company’s incompetence, that they decided to file a complaint.

She wanted to set up a joint account with them to make it easier to transfer funds from her account. We had a joint account with a local credit union, but it required her to physically deposit the money because it was a pain to move directly from PNC. I had my reservations after having an account with them about 8 years ago but went ahead with it in hopes of making it easier on her. As a contractor, I often get paid paper checks, so in most cases, I’m driving to a branch to deposit my paychecks regardless. So I go to deposit my first check. The teller offers to cash the check for no fee, but I tell her I’d like to deposit the check instead. I check my account after I get back to the job site to find my deposit is on hold. So I called customer service and found out that funds would be available after 10pm the same day, and if I had paid a fee they could have expedited it, but I didn't so there was nothing to do but wait now. That was frustrating but fine I’ll wait until 10pm I thought, except funds weren't there at 10pm. About 2am I got an email that my funds were available. I checked the balance and found it was only 200, a small fraction of my deposit. I called customer service and was on the line for well over an hour until I was finally transferred to a very rude supervisor who tried to talk to me like an insubordinate employee. I finally hung up on her. I understand new accounts, regardless of which institution you bank with, typically have wait periods. However they were willing to cash my check immediately without a fee, or the notion that funds would’ve been made immediately if I had paid a fee, tells me the “need to verify funds” is bunk. According to the supervisor I talked to, even after the account has aged there will always be a business day hold. It’s not verification they are after, it’s profit at their customers’ expense. Poor communication, horrible service, and exploitative practices. I’m in the process of closing the account. ",377,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,0

I started using PNC points for home expenses and PNC cash reward for work purchases, all my tools and materials, were paid weekly using cash rewards card and they were giving me peanuts  as a cash reward because it is a cash reward account. Week after week for months and my credit was improving, one day around September 2018 I didn’t use the card for the entire week because I was off that week, but my credit card continued accruing expenses like if I continued working that week( around $1800 dlls) (I use PNC online banking app) where I monitor in real time my expenses so you always know your daily and weekly expenses pending and posted transactions which reflected in the balance. Balance plus pending transactions  you always have control of your debt and know exactly how much you owe. Somehow they managed to use my previous transactions to which I believe they included in my weekly expenses to steal my money but I was in doubt so I said to myself maybe I was wrong and I owed more and accepted the fact. I continued my life like if nothing happened and about a few months around March 2019 my balance on my cash rewards was around $3500,00 and and my PNC points was about $2000,00 so that Sunday morning using my computer I logged in and made 2 payments $1500,00 to my PNC to my cash rewards card and $500,00 to my PNC points visa card so Monday morning Y was expecting my balance to be Cash rewards $2000,00 and my PNC points $1500, guess what, my PNC points visa card was reflecting  $1500,00 but my cash rewards was reflecting $2380 where did my $380 dollars go. So again a payment was showing that I paid $1500(in green numbers) but my balance was missing $380 so $1800 on September 2017 plus $380 on March 2019 please note that I had no pending transaction over $100,00 coming in that week. when I confronted them by phone and I was speaking with someone a clown voice in the background stated  (How did you know) At which I responded because I’m not stupid, I used PNC app online banking to track my expenses but they never credited the disputed amount stealing my money and did challenge me to prove it in a mocking way. I visited different local branches including the one where I originally opened my accounts and they refused to believe that this was happening, then I visited my closest branch from home  6535 Lake Worth Rd, Lake Worth, FL 33467 and the branch manager a woman Which surname is (Fifi) invited me to close my accounts instead of refunding my money. Again, I want people to know that this guys are vulgar rats, stealing my kids future. Nevertheless saying my interest rates increased to criminal 35% and every month I was paying almost $300 in interest charges for cash rewards and $90 for  PNC points and that’s not the worst, I paid them interest for over a year from money stolen from me. At this point in time I’m sure I was targeted by the bank administration to steal from me instead of profit from me, because when my credit was around 780 I asked for a loan to buy a mobile home for my family  an they declined twice one for a home and one for a dump truck. I just moved my money out of this racist people. I hope this helps other people to watch over their accounts closely and thanks for reading all the way here and please like and share so other people know.

I contacted Customer Service, and they said the transactions looked fraudulent, and I confirmed that they were. I was told they caught things in time and they would not process them. They also suggested that I change debit cards to make sure it didn't happen again. On Tuesday (after New Year's Day on Monday), I went to the branch in the morning and changed cards. Later in the day, I looked and saw that the transactions had gone through; they hadn't been stopped by PNC Customer Support as they had said they would be. They asked if I wanted to file a dispute of the charges, which means the money taken out would not be available until 10 business days, and then just provisionally. The dispute could go on for another 3 months, and the money would just be provisionally mine until it is resolved. That's unacceptable. PNC failed to decline the transactions when they were posted, as they said they would. Maybe due to their outdated IT systems, probably old IBM mainframe computers with a screen-scraper interface to make it look like a modern GUI interface. I suspect their technology is outdated. The bottom line is, even if you report a charge as fraudulent right away like I did, PNC does not take responsibility for what happens. Your money is not safe in a PNC account! I am in the process of moving my money to Chase where I have another checking account. PNC's Customer Service has always been lacking, and this is my final exposure to their outmoded way of doing things. Be cautious!",277,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

So the next day it was posted for $420 and left me with an overdraft. Contacted the bank and the basically told me to 1. File a dispute and 2. Go to my local branch to get a new account number. So looked online and the fraudulent transaction wasn't even listed. Call the bank again and they filed a dispute at their end. At that point that transaction actually was listed online, however my account was now in the negative. I complained again that that meant when my paycheck was direct deposited It would all be taken to pay for the overdraft! Again was told their was nothing they could do until it went through. Next day my paycheck went through and as I expected was not enough to completely cover the overdraft so account was still in the red. I did go up to the local branch and tried to at least get a new account number. And was told I had to open a new account. Needed $25 to do so. I don't have $25. My account is I'm the negative and I had no cash. I am disabled so don't earn much at all.instead the put a hold on my account so no money could be taken out. Ok, fine but I told them I am disabled and need my money to pay for an important prescription. They gave me a # to call. Who could help me getting emergency credit. I did. Was told they would review and make a decision within 48 hours. That was all on Friday. It I'ts now Monday and nothing has changed. To resolve the dispute will take 10 business days, so here I am. No money, no medicine and my electricity will be turned off soon. So guess I'll just die here, just a question of how. Freeze to death in the dark? Die because I can't pay for insulin. Maybe just starve!  What I really don't get in all of this is why the hell they even post ""pending"" transactions if there's no way to do anything about them.I realize the fraud isn't PNCs fault. Someone stole my account number and used my account to pay their credit card bill. So why couldn't I dispute it before it went through and at least prevent my paycheck from being taken up by the overdraft. Even if I got some cash put in I can't touch it now until I get a new #. And then I have to find a ride to the bank to get that done. This all happened over a weekend just before a major holiday. What am I supposed to do! So 1. Why wasn't able to stop the fraud before it happened? Could have at least stopped my paycheck from being taken like it was 2. Why did they tell me to get a new # without telling me it would mean opening a new account which would require cash? 3. Why hasn't anything been done to at least get me the emergency credit?

I have had nothing but problems since banking with PNC and it has only been a couple of months. Their employees are rude, nonchalant, and racist. I recently needed to visit a local branch to get some cash since I had not received my replacement card at the time. The branch lobby was closed and by appointment only, but I was unaware of that. I did not want to go through the drive thru since I was not driving. And you cannot use the cardless feature on the app at the ATM if you do not have a PNC bank card activated on your account. One of their elitist and nasty employees saw that I needed help and refused to assist me or even ask if I needed anything. I left because I did not want to end up getting shot for being Black or arrested for assault if I would have lost my temper! I contacted corporate and of course they apologized but it means nothing. These companies could not care less about Black people. How can any company say that Black Lives Matter when your entire executive board is filled with White people??? There are countless persons of color, including myself, that have college degrees and never even get considered for executive positions, so let's just keep it all the way real. The PNC phone and chat employees are also rude and incompetent. How can you not know about the products and services of the company you choose to work for??? This is why customer service is dead and a thing of the past. These companies make billions of dollars and they pay lower level employees chump change and they come to work miserable with the pay and their personal lives. What kind of s*!t is this??? Makes no sense whatsoever. I will be more than happy when I am done with PNC. I realize that all companies have problems of some sort, but it seems like many of these corporations are run by people who lack working brain cells and simple human decency.

The worst banking experience EVER--froze me out of my account for a week without any notice to me--leaving me scrambling to pay my rent that I had scheduled to be paid through my PNC Account.  I am NOT talking about a check hold.  This money had been in my account for a month and a half.  They still have not returned all my money.  I opened a new account with PNC Bank in June 2022 after I moved to a different area, with a cashier's check and two $100 money orders.  They could not be bothered to call the issuing bank for the check until the next day.  And made a big stupid deal about whether I could open a new account with a cashier's check.  ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?  The check was cleared the next day, but they put an extended hold on the $100 money orders--which I thought was crazy.  They had been fooled by a money order before they said.  I thought that was the point of using a money order that it is as good as cash-apparently not.  But the real crazy was yet to come.  I made additional deposits over the next month.On Sunday, July 31 paid my rent online with my PNC account.  On Monday, August 1, 2022, I got a low balance email alert from my PNC Bank account. I looked on my account and it showed I had money but said $0 ""available"" balance.  I called CS and she (dumb) said the bank had decided ""they did not want a relationship with me"", but would send me my money in TWO WEEKS by mailing me a cashier's check for my money.  What about the rent that's due now?  I asked for her supervisor (dumber).  He didn't know anything.  He gave me apparently the wrong phone number to ""account closure"". I called ""account closure"" and their answering machine said it was the ""check fraud"" department and if I left a message they were not the right department they would not call back.  What you cannot bother to call a customer back to re-direct my call?  Apparently not b/c they never called me back.  I called and emailed the Arlington, TX PNC Branch repeatedly.  The woman who I spoke with, Betty, had set up my account in the first place.  I told her I wanted my money NOW.  She lied and said they had already mailed the casher's check to me.  I asked by certified mail?  She didn't know.  She told me her manager's name, Adrian and he would call me back.  But he didn't call me that day.  I asked her for the manager's manager/director's number.  She refused to give it to me.  She said I had to go through channels. I told her for that to work the manager had to call me back.  In the meantime I'm scrambling to pay my bills and rent with no access to my funds, after incurring a NSF fee when PNC Bank did not honor my rent payment and I incurred a $42 FedEx fee to overnight a rent check from another account to the leasing office.  I spoke with PNC Branch Manager Adrian on Wednesday or Thursday  and he was going to look into it.  Crickets.  On Friday we spoke and he said I could come pick up a cashier's check for my money.  He didn't say what changed or why I couldn't get my money from Monday to Friday up to that point, despite my repeated demands, and now I could.  What happened?   He said that PNC had probably sent me a letter explaining.  I told him NO, PNC Bank hadn't sent me ANYTHING and the only way I knew they had frozen my account was a low balance alert I had set up.  Adrian said they were holding $1,000 for a mobile deposit I had made on July 11.  I asked why, he said they were holding it for 5 business days.  I asked him if he was aware that today was August 5th, and his explanation made no sense.  5 business days had long since passed.  I walk into the bank Friday to get my check and Betty says, oh they decided they will keep your account open.... after ALL THAT.  I asked her who in their right mind would continue to do business with PNC Bank?   I got all my money out of my account except that $1,000.  I am still waiting to see what lies I will hear and hoops I have to jump through to get the last of my funds out of the grasp of PNC Bank.  I asked Adrian why they were holding my $1,000.  He said he didn't know but once I got it I would have to go back up to the PNC Branch to close my account to keep from accruing fees.  I hate them so much right now.I suggest anyone even considering using PNC Bank to run, RUN, unless you want them to freeze access to your money, without notice to you, for a week at a time, bounce your rent payments, and keep portions of your funds indefinitely without explanation.  Outrageous!   It appears that PNC Bank's security is so lacking, and they have been fooled so much, that they will put everyday customers like myself through hell to the point that it frustrates the whole point of having a demand account.  If you cannot pay me my money on demand, and you make my payments for my obligations late as a result, what good are you as a bank?  NONE.",934,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

I opened an account when I moved to Georgia in 2015. The Palmetto branch is well run, but PNC corporate has many drawbacks. I had my account go negative a few years ago when my wife died and a month later Social Security debited her last benefit check back... typical government. The local branch worked it out with me but otherwise I would have been hit with fees for 4 days (PNC charges, or used to charge, a recurring fee for the first 4 days your account is negative whether any new transactions have gone through or not.) Second, I tried to get my house refinanced to fix my septic tank and PNC was there for every step, calls each day to update me until they decided that they would not do the refinancing. One day I stopped hearing from them until I got the form letter a week and a half later that they would not be doing the refinancing... basically they talked to me until they decided that they would not do my refinancing (and get the interest payments for it) and then I was not worth talking to or emailing. The final straw was this spring. I had a house in another state that I finally got to sell. I needed a form notarized since it was a cash sale. I went into the local branch (they have a notary, I know because I had called) to get it notarized and was told that they only notarize real estate that is done through PNC. So I had to find another notary and pay to get it done even though I had been a PNC customer for years and had never missed any payments to anybody or bounced any checks.

I’ve been trying to reach out to the fraud department for the passed week now and nothing. Yesterday, around 6 PM they had another incompetent supervisor returned my call, but only to find that she did not feel like doing any work. So, she kept pretending not to hear me. This representative thought it was my telephone line that was giving troubles, when it was actually PNC piece of crap phone that was causing the interference. She called like 5 times and, I even returned her call on other phone line and she still kept pretending not to hear me. Way to go PNC!!!!",161,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,-1,-1

In my opinion, a better slogan for this bank would have been ""Our Customer Is Our Adversary.""  Ever since taking over BBVA bank out here on the West Coast in 2021, PNC's heavy-handed and authoritarian manner during this time led to an unsurprising mass exodus of BBVA customers.  I should have been one of them.  Over the past three years, this ""boring"" bank has proven its disrespectful, adversarial treatment of its customers over and over again.  God forbid your account ever becomes overdrawn - PNC bank allows only ONE overdraft item per year.  Recently, a government debit that was applied to my account several weeks early resulted in an overdraft situation.  Over the following days, my account was consistently charged $36 per item, to cover multiple merchant processing fees as small as 13, 39 and 52 cents each.  This resulted in 18 overdraft charges - a total of $648 removed from my account.  PNC's 'customer service' will not even address this issue, and I was informed again of their 'one overdraft allowed per year' rule.During this time, not one bank manager or representative reached out to enquire if they could assist in any way.  This bank's adversarial behavior and almost derisive treatment of customers will not sustain itself for much longer in California.  The two branches near me are pitifully empty most of the time, except for the unfortunate 'bored' people who work there.

If you take it up one more level you are nicked and timed to just to transfer money in 24 hours.  So if you are using a third party software like QB’s to manage your money this is not worth it.

The PNC customer service person gave me the wrong advice. She should have told me that the check had been issued and I should wait a little longer. As it turned out the hospital charged me a fee for the cancelled check. They eventually refunded the fee but not without a lot of difficulty. Now I paid this hospital bill on the hospital website. Immediately after I received 2 emails from PNC indicating that the bill was paid twice. So I logged into my account and PNC does have the transaction listed as being paid twice. I called the hospital first this time and I was told that the payment was only in their system once, NOT twice. I was advised to call the bank. I called PNC and there ARE 2 payments made but since they did not hit the system yet I should call back tomorrow to get the one transaction disputed and a refund issued. I am truly afraid that the bill will not be paid and I will have to go through another mess to clear this up.

A few months ago I got a check form selling property I wished to deposit and went to my local branch, they were changing the ATM over to PNC from BBVA so I couldn't use that, the check was too large for my mobile deposit limit, so my option becomes going inside. I asked to deposit the check and they were not capable of doing it, something with the merger, he said to use the ATM. I pointed to the fact that it wasn't able to be used. I asked what we can do, given that I took time from work and my day to do this and didn't want to sit on a 50k check. Nothing, they hve no plan in place at all, even opening another account wasn't an option. He told me I could try another ATM, which I did, but that ATM did not take checks. I followed up with customer service stating how unacceptable this is. You're a bank PNC, I should be able to deposit a check without taking literal hours from my day. They gave me the address of an ATM that accepts checks, I went and guess what the ATM was not equipped to do? That's right, accept checks, I called customer service back and they could offer me an apology, nothing of substance. I opened an account with Chase and deposited there. Fast forward to yesterday, I needed to withdraw $800. My debit card was expired and I had not received a new one, so I used my wife's, but the transaction was declined, so I called in and they said it wasn't activated (lies, she withdrew a few days before) and they had me try again, failure. So now I got transferred and he said he'd need my wife, I said I'd conference her in, but no, she has to call directly, even though they'll ask security questions. He wouldn't explain why, just that it's ""policy"". Now I decide that it's time to just go ahead and get a card printed, so I go to a bank that does that, but I call first and ask ""is there any reason wouldn't be able to print a card today?"". He said no unless the machine acts up, so I make my way there. I walk in, and I'm obviously annoyed, given that so far I have had two interactions in six months with this garbage institution, to deposit a check and withdraw $800 - I was able to accomplish neither and had spent 4 to 5 hours on both. That's just plain absurdity. When I say I need a debit card printed, she asked for two forms of ID. I was not told I needed two forms when I called. So I scrambled for an insurance card, which I did not have, then she asked about the app, which I logged into, but that wasn't enough, then she asked for a credit card and said, ""see, that's all"" (naturally I was pissed. Credit cards aren't ID, but sure, take it if this will work). She also asked about my other experience and I told her it was during the merger, ""in a dismissive tone she says that was a while ago"". Okay? So did that not happen then? But later she tells me I need an attitude adjustment, but maybe the people in your building can actually properly communicate when a question is asked instead of taking the lazy way out. Then she started getting confused because I opened the account in my old home state and asked if I had my old ID. Why? Why would I carry around my old license? Is the PNC staff trained to ask incredibly stupid questions? When you have a customer in front of you that's been treated like trash by your institution for hours, don't ask stupid questions. I told her I needed $800, she eventually got me the card and I went to the drive thru ATM, guess what didn't work? Withdrawing the money. So I needed to call customer service and ask why. Now this guy sent me a pin to my phone to verify the information. Four times he asked me to repeat it and kept repeating it wrong. He finally, finally was able to comprehend the six digits, hey thanks for listening pal. He then tells me I have a $500 withdrawal limit. $500? What is this a bank for ants? I asked to increase it, citing it's my money, if I want it, I should get it, he said the max he could do is $750. So I'd need to know why the lazy worker inside decided not to tell me getting $800 would be impossible. So I walk right back to her and I'm pissed off, as I should be, because the incompetence of this bank is astounding and tell her I need to withdraw $800. She says she's working on another transaction and sends me away and some other worker, assuming manager comes (she was likely messaged on Slack, Teams, or whatever they use) because I was irate. She asked if I was trying to with draw money. ""for three hours now, yeah"" I basically told her PNC sucked. Did she help? Nah, just stood there. So I called my friend and asked if he can withdraw $800 from the bank. He said, ""of course"". So I sent him $800 and got him to do it at his bank. That's how I had to get my money from PNC. That's how I had to deposit a check.",944,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

The fact that PNC NEVER worked with me to let me know the outcome of their internal investigation is really poor service for this situation.

We decided to explore the home equity line of credit and chose to apply for one with PNC bank because their interest rates were better than similar offerings with other groups.  The PNC associates were friendly and helpful and the application process wasn't too hard...however our troubles began right after the application process was triggered.Not five minutes after finishing the application, the phone number we used on the form started getting telemarketer spam calls for similar lien/mortgage/line-of-credit products.It's been two weeks since then and we regularly receive 20 or more solicitation calls PER DAY.  The phone number is on the national do not call list, but it hasn't seemed to help.I even engaged in conversation with one of the solicitors and found out that it was a PNC affiliate (Transunion, used for the credit score check) from which they had received our information.During the application process there was a box we had to check saying that we agreed to share our information with PNC affiliates so that the proper background checks, home evaluations, and credit checks could be performed.   I don't know that the application could have been approved without us authorizing them to share the info.    However what has happened crosses a line and is to the level of harassment.  Would this have happened with any other bank we chose to work with?   Is there anything we could have done to prevent such things from happening in the future?In my mind, a critical metric for any bank should be how well they handle a person's private information and if they are taking steps to ensure that something like what we experienced should never happen.  PNC is a big bank, they could throw some weight to have prevented that.   I'm sure they're earning some kind of kickback in partnership revenue shares from Transunion being able to sell our information.

There are no physical locations close to us, so we drove 90 miles to the nearest branch in Owensboro Ky. We met with a gentleman who explained that he would contact the payoff dept and they would fax him a final payoff amt. He asked us to return in a couple of hrs and he would have that payoff statement for us. We came back later, as directed, and he gave us a letter stating the final payoff if it was pd in 10 days. We went to our personal bank the next morning and got a cashier's check FOR THAT AMOUNT IN FULL and mailed it immediately. Imagine our surprise a few days later when the bank called and said that we didn't pay enough!!! They claimed that we still owed another $150. When I pressed the caller as to why we still owed she kept saying someone made a math error on their end or they keyed in the wrong figure by mistake. This is unacceptable! They CONVENIENTLY offered to take the amt from our escrow acct which we had been assured would be refunded. This is wrong, unfair and PNC pulled a fast one.

When I tried doing the payment, they locked my account again and wouldn't process the transaction. They gave zero reason why. So I went to the bank and asked for help. I had wonderful service from the teller, but all she could do was tell me to call the help line with her there, so I did. After waiting for 30 minutes they answered, only to put me on hold again for another 30 minutes. When they finally answered, they told me ""a branch member has to call."" They wouldn't let me hand the phone to the branch member right there, so she had to call the same help line and wait an outlandishly long time. Major red flag is that the tellers have the same help line as the customers.When they finally answered her, after waiting a similar amount of time, they told her that I needed to call them and not her. I left because I needed to be at work, but I called again later. Luckily, I only needed to wait 10 minutes before anyone answered. Unfortunately, they took my information, said they'd put me on hold, and hung on me. So I called again and waited another 10 minutes. Rather than helping me, like you think customer service would do, they told me a branch member needed to call and then lied to me about how the branch member that I saw call them never called. Immediately after the call, I made a new account at another bank.",362,Company has NOT responded to this review.,1,0,-1

Over the last 24 hours with waiting hours on the phone and using there online app. I'm done. The worst customer service I've experienced. I used the word sucky service to a representative and got excused of my language. I was told to expedite a new card because my account was compromised I had to wait 4 weeks for a new card. So no access to funds for a month. But if I call tomorrow before 2 they could expedite it. I waited 30 mins for this call. It was before 2 on Monday. Just make the request. So I'm done. I set up my main account to transfer my money out to transfer my balance and then I go into a loop. I verified the account 3 times. Still nothing. So now I have to waste my time with a phone call.  These companies want you to use there apps for customer service. But you always have to end up calling but there reps hands are tied. I see from simple searches that PNC is in trouble. I now know why. Customer service is myth to them. They could care less about there customers.,199,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

PNC seems confused about what a bank is/does..basically math…and whose money they have.  Hint:  it’s not theirs!  I can count on one hand the overdrafts I’ve had in the decades I’ve been their customer (usually because some someone illegally took thousands of dollars from the account which has happened more than once). And, although Ive been their ‘very good customer’..their words.. and overdrafts are backed up by my other PNC accounts, they still charge you.  They make it almost impossible to do anything about your account/money. Basically, take the day off to get through to anyone…who will usually send you somewhere else. They’ll give your money away to anyone. As I said, thousands have illegally been taken from my account which processed IMMEDIATELY, but a $10 check to me will sit in pending for days.  When my new debit card needed activated, I had to call…even though they say you can do it online…on their site that’s down for updates constantly, and it used to be automatic based on your phone number, but now it’s wait and wait and get transferred and hung up on.  Yet, after I activated new card, they were still processing charges on old card..so a lot of autopay accounts took money twice! I’ve put a limit on when to be notified if a charge exceeds a certain amount. Never happens. They’ll cash a ‘check’ written on a napkin from a stranger, but I have to answer 12 questions to speak to anyone, and, of course, I’m wrong, because I suddenly forgot my pin or SSN?! They are not only criminally incompetent, they’ll do anything to try and overdraft your account, find anyway to take your money, and don’t ever get a credit card through them….highest interest I’ve seen.  But although I pay my card in full, on time, plus whatever interest they charge so I’m actually paying off debt, they get upset if you use your card!  ‘Update your income!’emails come as soon as you charge anything. It’s the same income they’ve been playing fast and loose with for years.

They also are at best exceptionally uninformed, and at worst, dishonest. In my case PNC began unilaterally withholding funds under the pretense that I had supplied the wrong SSN. This turned out to be inaccurate. After speaking at length with reps at PNC corporate, the chandler branch, and the IRS the conclusion is that PNC made a clerical error with information submitted to the IRS which prompted the IRS to indicate to the bank that some piece of information they submitted for taxable investment income was incorrect. Instead of following protocol and communicating with me, or correcting their own error, they made no required attempts to contact me in advance of withholding funds under a B-withholding. Instead they proceeded under the assumption that information that has been correct for a number of years suddenly was incorrect versus the more likely scenario that PNC had made an error. They produced tax docs both ‘23 and ‘24 fine, but for some reason all the sudden Jan 2025 my info is wrong and in the same month they unilaterally withdraw funds from the account. When contacting the branch for assistance they demonstrated no understanding, knowledge, or resolution for how they may correct the error even when they acknowledged it was obviously an error of their own making. I was told a few times it was corrected by the branch banker when it was not which would have led to more funds being withheld each month had I trusted the branch bank representative. Trust and PNC clearly should not go together. In the process I have provided several tax forms with personal information, but as of yesterday the corporate representatives could not locate any of them which raises significant concerns regarding their commitments to securing customer personal information and fraud preventions protocols. How can one trust a bank that loses pertinent personal information? The only legitimate recourse offered as a resolution was to close my account completely because they could not figure out how to return nearly $400 they unilaterally withheld under at best incompetent, and at worst fraudulent, pretenses. They also could not figure out how to cease additional withholding going forward despite certifying my personal information and admitting the mistake is their own. The manager at the branch verbally committed to getting back to me about necessary steps to close the account and retrieve all funds, but she failed to even fulfill that most basic commitment. No return call. As a result, I sent emails directly to the CEO and other executives outlining my concerns. That at least prompted a fairly immediate return call from another branch in Tempe and a corporate retail representative in Pittsburgh. Although I was told by the person they assigned to assist she would also get back to me. When I contacted her directly the next morning she advised she hadn’t had time to work on it and could not even recall who I was. I was informed by their own staff that inquiries have a 48 resolution  goal so complicated issues rarely get resolved because their service team transfers the case # before 48 hours to avoid failing to meet the corporate goal. Service infinity loop! In my situation I have been transferred every 2 days for a few weeks now with not so much as a call from any of these reps assigned to my inquiry.  Their own staff didn’t even heed a request from their executive team to assist me after I had reached out. As a result I am left with no other option but to file formal complaints with the FDIC, FTC, OCC and CFPB in the hopes that their regulators with compel them to fix their error and communicate with their customer. Would I bank with PNC ever again? No way. My situation may be unique, but why would anyone save or invest money with an institution that will take your money without warning, admit they made a mistake, and then still refuse to correct their error and return funds.",681,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,0,-1

I did return that afternoon and waited awhile before being told come back Monday. The teller said she was having “issues”. All I needed was 5 minutes of her time to advise me. Promptly went to another bank that wasn't having “issues” and opened an account. Somethings you don't want to talk to a teller about especially when she is the only one and dividing her time between the drive-thru as well as working the counter.

Lisa DeFilippo, the branch sales and service representative drew the process out for a month, did not follow up on document submissions, and gave incorrect information regarding the process. I was told to return with Surrogate/ Executor paperwork so that the custodial savings account could be transferred to my name and that then I could do whatever I wanted with the account. After calling three times and returning a third time, I was informed that checks would be issued in the minor’s name for $100 and a now adult child’s name for $15- yes, minimal amounts.All bank representatives should be well versed in the process and courteously guide estate executives through the process. Customers should not have to return multiple times and contact the bank and branch manager for assistance. George Maloney, the branch manager was unable to assist in Lisa’s absence and refused to honor the process of transferring ownership to the executor as outlined by his bank representative. He also refused to disclose contact details for the legal department to verify the account closure process. PNC Bank should ensure that its representatives are informative, transparent, accountable and offer expeditious support to customers. Multiple patrons of color attempting to close out accounts or transfer ownership of accounts experienced insensitive service at this branch.

We had opened an account because they are very convenient (within waking distance from our home and drive by it on our way home and on the way to the supermarket), they are easy to use online, and there are enough ATMs tat there is always access. I was sick and missed a credit card payment because I fell asleep when I meant to pay the balance and woke up 20 minutes after  the midnight deadline and paid the bill. They were nice when I asked for them to waive the late fee and reversed that. The late payment triggered an interest charge for the balance for the month that should have bred reversed also. 6 months and seven requests later, the interest charge was finally reversed. My fourth complaint was 4 mounts after the late fee was reversed and they claimed it was too late as they can only correct items within 90 days of the initial event. Of course the initial request and my first two follow up calls that they failed to respond to with a correction were within 90 days. We foolishly opened a business account there and it took 2 hours to open the account and the account was named incorrectly. That was caught while we were opening the account t it the debit card we received the next week had the incorrect account name that had supposedly been eliminated. They then requested that we come in again and sign the forms for the correct name (which we had done twice in the ridiculously long initial two hour account opening). We tried to use their online system to set up an automatic credit card payment to avoid another late fee. In June, that did not work and we incurred another late fee. We went in to the office and we told immediately that the online automatic payment system did not work and we needed to fill out a written physical request there in the office to set it up. We then requested that they waive the late fee because it was their online system that resulted in the payment failure. The system is flawed and they knew it but failed to correct it to take advantage of the resulting late fees. They denied the request to reverse the late fee after 6 weeks and multiple promises to return our calls and give us a decision by the next week. The fees that were involved were all minimal but they stuck to their guns to deny any help or consideration to demonstrate that they have the worst customer service of any bank on the planet.

I was very embarrassed by the entire situation on both occasions not being able to make my purchase and having other customers witness this difficulty.  As a long-time customer transitioning from Compass/BBVA to PNC I did not feel valued or that I had a competent team to resolve my issue. I decided it was time to allow another institution to handle most of my banking transactions.  I visited your local branch in Pelham, Al to cancel my account and transfer some funds to the new bank. The agent reviewed my account and saw my efforts to resolve the issue and stated it appears it was not the bank it was the merchant. PNC did not take the appropriate actions and I did not feel like my business was important. The new bank identified my PNC debit card chip was causing the error and I only needed a new debit card. Because I had some pending transaction and would not be able to complete my bank change until next week I went back to PNC for a new debit card. I was informed they do not provide onsite debit card and the branch that do did not have any on hand. I was offered the option to order one that will take three weeks. On the other hand the new bank provided me a debit card the same day. Do PNC have the staff employed that can provide the customer service needed to retain customers and to resolve simple issues. I am in customer service and find this level of service unacceptable.

I went in person to a brach where they had no idea what was going on and eventually told me that my account was made online and I have to work it out over the phone because they have no control over online banking. I call the people back just to be told to go to a branch again. I tell them I did. Then I spend 5 hours the phone get transferred to the highest department(meanwhile I have yet to be told once about what is even going on). I get to the final department and they tell me ""the department I need does not exist for the online high yield savings"". They told me I will be receiving a call later on. 3 days later I get a call and they say they don't know what to do or why its closed. I then just beg them to please close my account and transfer the money back to the bank it came from. I am currently still waiting for the transfer. I received zero answers from PNC of why or any solutions on how to fix it. I have never dealt with such an unorganized company before and the savings you earn is not worth it.

The insurance checks that they were supposed to send to me to pay for the damage were held up for MONTHS! They kept claiming that they didn’t have an inspector in my region, so they weren’t able to send out the checks. I, as a last ditch effort to speed things up, told them that I’d arrange and pay for the inspection myself to get the payment and was told no. After several month of calling( hours upon hours) I finally got the checks after showing pictures of the repairs.( why wasn’t this allowed to begin with?!!!)Now I have problems signing in on my account every month.

This bank is the worst. After completing a wire transfer from my account to purchase a home in a different state, I went in to have the second wire transfer done and they refused. My only option was a certified check which I had to overnight the check and wait for it to clear. After the second transaction I received a letter stating they were closing my account in roughly 25 days. I pay all my bills online through the bank or my credit card. I was treated extremely rudely by the branch who refused to return two phone calls to me. In the meantime, I was closing out a large investment account and asked to have the funds wired into another account under my name. Two days went by, and I saw no movement in my account. Luckily, I phoned the bank’s wire transfer department and was told that they couldn’t see the transfer and believed it had not been initiated. At the same time, after removing my auto pay accounts except for two that were due immediately, I saw online they had not paid one of the auto pays. Another trip to the branch since they wouldn’t return my phone call.

We were told without accepting the debit card-- and using it a minimum number of times on qualifying purchases over the next 3 months-- we would not receive the $500 reward. SO-- we took the debit card.3. We were told paper statements would cost us money, so we opted for online only banking. One month later, a mysterious $3.00 charge appeared in our online statement. I called the bank rep to ask what this unexpected fee was, and she said that was the fee that went with that type of account. I asked her to show me where, in any of the website material, that was stated. She couldn't. When I pushed, she said she would have it removed. It wasn't removed.Now suspicious, I challenged the mandatory debit card and asked where THAT requirement was listed. She took a day or so and then got back to me saying there had been a ""miscommunication."" (? We have NEVER had, and said quite clearly we did not WANT a debit card, and there was a miscommunication?) I asked her to cancel the card, which she did.Next, she notified me that using the debit card had reduced our balance below the required $35,000 we had deposited... What? We had deposited more than the required thirty, and I pointed out the required minimum was $30,000, not $35,000. She said she would check on it-- then emailed me the amount was $35,000. I asked for her to direct me to the place in the PNC website that said it was 35, not 30.She stopped responding to my emails. I finally called the PNC customer support line to get this resolved. This representative said the mystery $3.00 fee was for paper statements. I pointed out we had never received a single paper statement. She immediately reversed the charge. (Why wasn't that done when the original rep said she would??)She also confirmed, multiple times and with other PNC people, that the minimum for this reward was, in fact, the $30,000--not $35,000.Won't know for sure for another 3 or 4 months whether--after all this--we actually get the ""reward"" for enduring this crappy experience.

That is the thanks we get for staying with PNC after the merge which cost us staff hours to update all of our accounts, purchase new company checks, time with quick book staff to update our payroll, etc. I am beyond disappointed with this financial institution and would NEVER recommend them.

I don't blame you for casting doubt on my story but I assure you it is all true and verifiable because the branch called the police and I'm sure there is a record. As I write this it is Sunday afternoon. I am sitting in what is my new lodgings which happens to be a blue port a potty on an abandoned job site. It is raining. I have not eaten since noon Friday. My water ran out last night. When my truck was impounded they allowed me to get what I could carry but nothing could be left on the side of the road so all my possessions left as well. I am 1,000 miles from home. I was a normal , responsible person with employment and I considered myself an asset to society as a whole. That all changed at 5:30pm Friday afternoon at a PNC branch near Cincinnati when I put my ATM card in their machine which promptly confiscated it. I went inside to inform them of the problem to which their answer was ""Call your bank"". They informed me that although the ATM is on their property, has their logo on it and they do business with it that they don't own or have any control over it. My bank will not mail a new card to me because my residence at the time was a hotel as I was out of my area working. At this point PNC bank had left me destitute. You had taken the only access to my finances. Saturday after opening I went back to the branch to seek help. My rent was due. I was low on fuel and had not eaten in almost 24 hours.( At 48 hours the pains seem to subside but the longings for food does not) I had found a checkbook and re-entered the branch, after talking to my bank who gave me several options , I was pleading for help. I was adamant about presenting solutions to the scenario which came about as soon as your ATM took my card. I offered several solutions but was rejected to the offer! At this point I could tell they were done with me and that's when the police arrived. To shorten this story , mainly to conserve battery , let's jump to Saturday night. Since I could not pay room rent I packed my belongings in my truck and tried to get to my jobsite but ran out of fuel before I got there. Last night when the police arrived to investigate why I was there . I told them the story so far and that I was out of fuel and waiting on tomorrow to try to seek a remedy as I was now destitute and homeless because of PNC bank. I don't think they believed my story. Why shoud they? It sounds like a made up sob story and I am going thru it.  I don't think whoever reads this can ever fully understand or appreciate the shame of being penniless and homeless with no options. Where at every point help was available but refused solely because when we normal people see a begger or homeless we think I did it why can't they? What's wrong with them for being poor?I've been broke and homeless for a day now and I tear up at my attitude towards the less fortunate. I understand the shame of having nothing. I see the look in people's eye when they regard me. Asking for help, Telling a wild story of how ""Really, it's not my fault. I have money I just can't get to it right now"". I will thank PNC bank for one thing. You have opened my eyes to how close we ALL are to reverting to our animal instincts.  I will be drinking river water soon.I have not gone thru the dumpster yet but I fear it is in my future. I'm mainly hopping to find shelter material but some canned goods would be welcomed. I can bash it on the rock and drink whats inside if I find something.  Have you ever thought about how to open a can without an opener? I have.It's Sunday now. I hope to have better living arrangements by tonight because you can't really sleep sitting up in a port a potty I've found . At best you get a few naps in. So here we are ....     I'm broke,homelss, no vehicleHungry and hiding out like a criminal on old job site  I have no way of accessing g my funds. I was refused all help at the branch then you called the police to tell me I can't even sit in your lot while I figure this out  You have ruined my life. You have stolen my access to life's necessities with no apology or compassion. I have money. I have checks. In today's world I cannot believe such a simple thing has cost me so much. You had the chance to remedy the situation instead you chose to distance yourself from your responsibilities. Your actions have left me in a situation I may not survive all because your machine ate my card. What small things turn the wheel of life against you instead of for you.Monday...Daylight If you think you won't kill to survive,  your wrong. When faced with starvation the human animal will go to very drastic measures to continue life.5hats all it is. The single , sole very basic need to eat takes over.

Therefore for 3.5 years I received no correspondence from the bank for anything else other than marketing products. Unknowingly I underpaid  about $.56 a month so after a few months they charged a late fee, which repeatedly grew per month. Thankfully they reversed it when I called to pay off the loan early.  My biggest disappointment was that they would not provide a letter releasing me from the lien unless I paid $26 to an outside entity. Even after doing so, they refused to send me the title. A duplicate cost me $85 at the Florida DMV county clerk’s office. I will not ever deal with them again. This story did not have a happy ending.

With 1000 pounds on a dolly, it was difficult. After waiting in line, I go through the process of checking out. My card comes up declined. Mind you, I put close to $1500 in the day previous. I try again. And again. Declined three times. Now, I’m embarrassed, there’s a bunch of people in line. I check my account balance for my primary virtual wallet PNC checking account. It reads $958 of accessible funds. I am purchasing $508 of merchandise, so what is the issue?I contact PNC. first guy disconnects the call unexpectedly. Maybe it’s bad reception? I call again. Menu prompts, finally get to PNC employee. I explain the situation. I have 1000 pounds of building material, my card is declining at checkout, I need help so I can complete the transaction.I am put on hold two times. Finally the PNC employee informs me that there is a freeze on my card and I need to talk to a specific department to unfreeze it. The employee that informs me that the current wait time is 60 to 90 minutes. I reiterate that I am in the front of a line with 1000 pounds of construction material. IThe employee gives a fake canned insincere apology, saying I would need to wait for someone else to lift the restriction PNC imposed.No one had contacted me or informed me of any reason for freezing my account. No emails, text, phone calls. Without any warning, PNC froze my account.I had been trying to be patient, but the lack of empathy or consideration for the grief PNC was causing me unnecessarily sent me over the edge. I informed the staff this situation was bs, that they were playing games with my money. I am a grown man trying to utilize the money that I earned and deposited into their bank.No empathy for the stress, embarrassment, frustration or financial losses this situation was causing me. the PNC employee ignored my grievances and complained about me swearing and having an attitude.Yeah, I’m gonna have an attitude when you freeze my funds, don’t contact me, don’t explain why, and refuse to address and correct the issue.The employee was being antagonistic. I explain how this situation is causing me tremendous grief, the PNC employee responds with “I’m sorry YOU feel that way.” …passive aggressive BS.The PNC employee then informed me that she would be discontinuing the call because of my swearing and disrespectful behavior. I didn’t start off swearing or disrespectful… Then the PNC employee hung up on me. I then waited on hold for nearly 2 hours, for someone who “could assist me”. The freeze was lifted pretty quickly, and the explanation provided was bs. They claimed my chip on debit card was acting up (sometimes not reading), so they assumed my card was fraudulent and locked my account. I’ve had this account for over 8 years, nearly 9 years. They didn’t reach out, just froze my account.PNC created an unnecessary problem by freezing my account. By the time they finally unfroze my account, the store had returned all the merchandise to their original stock locations. I had spent several hours gathering the stuff and labored to bring the material to the front of the store.Not only was my energy and time wasted, the poor store employees had to spend time and energy restocking 1000 pounds of construction material.By the time the “issue” (ie the bs drama PNC created) was “resolved” (ie - they finally stopped playing games with MY money); the store was about to close, my merchandise was gone, I lost a day I took off from work for, and my uhaul rental would need to be repeated. PNC played games with my money, prevented me from completing my business, and cost me nearly $200 in needing another uhaul rental, and another day to do something that would’ve otherwise been completed today.I lost money, time, and suffered unnecessary stress, anger and embrassment…because PNC decided to play games with my money.",746,Company has NOT responded to this review.,-1,-1,-1

DO NOT OPEN ACCOUNTS HER AND CLOSE ANY ACCOUNTS YOU DO HAVE.  In 2022, PNC acquired BBVA where I had been a customer for over 4-years without one single problem.  Never an overdraft or returned check.  Immediately upon my account offically becoming a PNC checking account, I had $265 in overdraft fees in the span of 5-days, with plenty of money in my account!  What they did was ignore my NO OVERDRAFT PROTECTION status of my BBVA checking account, implement their overdraft protection and then process the clearing of all my transactions in a manner that would generate a negeative balance in between transactions (as I made cash deposits every other day or so to cover the few trasactions the BBVA card was used for -- this was not my primary bank account) so they could slap a fee on top of every single one!  I realized what was happening so I went to the ATM and made a huge cash deposit.  A few weeks later it started again.  I went inside the bank this time and they agreed they were fraudulently charging my account and reversed $72 worth of overdraft fees.  THE NEXT DAY, I had $190 IN OVERDRAFT FEES ON MY ACCOUNT.  I closed it immediately.  Like, within the hour.  Then they had the unmitigated gall to mail me a bill for the $190 a week later!  I wrote them back that I was paying NOTHING until they produced a checking account agreement between us with my signature on it (I always used my BBVA debit card and never had a PNC debit card or PNC account number)Well, come to find out three years later, they reported this account to Early Warning Services as ""CLOSED FOR ACCOUNT ABUSE"" and listed a Principal Loss of $264.64 and Fee Reversals of $72.  But then they list the COMBINED LOSS & FEE REVERSALS as $0.00Zero???  I mean, wtf are they even reporting it for then???  Ha! Ha! Ha!  PNC bank is so f-ing corrupt it boggles the mind.

If you have a problem you’re on your own. I’ve been banking here since 2014. The virtual wallet account/features are fine, but the web based online banking and mobile app lag way behind their competitors and any time I’ve had an issue, their customer support has been nothing more or less than a shoulder to cry on. A few years back they decided to start blocking my acorns investment account round ups from being withdrawn from my checking account. I tried several times to address the issue with customer service but they were no help. Earlier this year I took out an auto loan to buy out my car lease. Honda requires a federal odometer statement to be completed and signed to release the title. PNC should know this, but when I presented that signed paper during my loan appointment I was told it wasn’t needed. I told the loan officer I was certain it was needed and asked that it be included with the check. Fast forward several weeks, PNC title department is blowing up my phone because they haven’t received the title. Meanwhile I’m getting letters from Honda that they haven’t received the  federal odometer statement. It took over a month of PNC calling me (the middle man) about their issue with Honda and the title. Then when Honda finally releases the title, I do the transfer at the NC DMV and I think I’m done. NOPE. A few weeks go by and I get a letter from the DMV stating that PNC is not compliant with an electronic lien holder law enacted in North Carolina in 2016. I’m informed the state will be holding my car title until the issue is resolved. At this time I was buying and remodeling a house so I let it go for a month or so and finally called PNC to inform them of the issue. Spent an hour plus on the phone with customer service. Read the letter several times to the agent who clearly didn’t understand what was I was talking about. They wouldn’t let me talk to the title department because they apparently only make outbound calls. Customer service finally suggested I send a FAX to their title department requesting a call back (stating they also “don’t have email”). So this resourceful millennial figured out how to send them a fax without a land line, without a fax machine but naturally I never heard back from them. After 6 months they finally resolved the issue with the state.

The Payment HQ is the best merchant services and most trustworthy company I have dealt with. They support my industry which is considered high risk and made it very easy to get me an account approved. Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what’s best for your business.

They have a reliable team. I own 7 machines now. And the experience was terrifying with things not working instantly. (If you work in tech, you get it) They have spent hours of no billing hours to make sure all 7 machines went up at the same time. I ordered through China originally and didn’t understand the 3 month wait. Getting machines in 7 days is a gift in its own. Their software is American made & American updated. This software team actually has follow through. Unlike a lot of these China manufacturers. Business is in the US, keep your software team in the US and use VapeTM.

I called and got connected with Ben, not some random sales representative from somewhere around the world. I spent a solid 20-30 minutes of Ben’s time asking a bunch of questions I had and he answered all of them very professionally which in turn made me feel comfortable with their product. I let Ben know that I would be in contact and that I wanted to think about it. There was absolutely no hard pressure sales at all, a few hours after thinking about it I decided I wanted to pull the trigger and so I reached back out to Ben and began the process. From there I ended up being in Ohio so I picked up my machine in person, I got to meet Ben, Jordan, and several others in person to truly see who I behind the company. I’m very happy with my purchase and even more happy with the customer service I have received from VapeTM, I have always gotten a response to any issue or question I have within minutes and it feels great to have a company back their product. We plan to buy several more, I can’t say enough good things about them! ",217,,1,1,1

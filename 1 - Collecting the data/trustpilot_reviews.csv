The 'authentication' (I guess) somehow gave sufficient proof so I was then able to log into my account.I also had a rather minor request to edit the names on specific accounts.My call was taken by Danielle and together we were able to address and resolve.Having employees who feel professional yet personable service are critical in securing confidence in both Evergreen and their employees.Your mission and mine were met by Danielle.",

Evergreen Credit Union,egcu.org,349,4.8,95%,2%,<1%,<1%,1%,5,"Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family.

I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up.

We went to let a teller know that we needed to speak to a loan officer, and then sat in the waiting area for 25 minutes while employees walked through the waiting area--no one making eye contact or saying anything. After the 25 minutes, a manager came out and asked if we had been helped, and if we had told a teller that we were there. After that a loan officer (Jorge) helped us draw up papers. Our 2nd visit was to finalize our transaction. I had emailed Jorge the day before to let him know what time we were able to come in. We peeked in to see if Jorge was busy, and he helped us immediately. I would give this visit 5 stars!

VapeTM,vapetm.com,31,4.7,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,5,"After a lot of research into the correct vending machine for us we decided to go with VapeTM. I called and got connected with Ben, not some random sales representative from somewhere around the world. I spent a solid 20-30 minutes of Ben’s time asking a bunch of questions I had and he answered all of them very professionally which in turn made me feel comfortable with their product. I let Ben know that I would be in contact and that I wanted to think about it. There was absolutely no hard pressure sales at all, a few hours after thinking about it I decided I wanted to pull the trigger and so I reached back out to Ben and began the process. From there I ended up being in Ohio so I picked up my machine in person, I got to meet Ben, Jordan, and several others in person to truly see who I behind the company. I’m very happy with my purchase and even more happy with the customer service I have received from VapeTM, I have always gotten a response to any issue or question I have within minutes and it feels great to have a company back their product. We plan to buy several more, I can’t say enough good things about them! ",

I ordered through China originally and didn’t understand the 3 month wait. Getting machines in 7 days is a gift in its own. Their software is American made & American updated. This software team actually has follow through. Unlike a lot of these China manufacturers. Business is in the US, keep your software team in the US and use VapeTM.

I Experienced frequent delays and unresponsive calls/texts during the period of using his service. He often used my large funds to fund his smaller transactions on the website first,  causing months of delay for me. When my project passed deadline due to his delays and caused me significant financial losses, I asked him to cancel the transactions he's delayed and held. He THEN sends them through anyway just to make up volumn for his investors, charged me a big% fee on top. When confronted,  he promised the return of the fees on the transactions he made PASSING the promised delivery date  it's now 4 months later.  He's still dodging my calls,  txts, messages, still owe me thousands. My over all experience,  crypro dispenser is ran by someone who's not reliable, he promises the world when he wants your money,  then dodges your calls when he owes you. The owner thanked me on the phone because my volumn got him investors for his business, and then makes promises and disapears.  I'm still very upset that I can't locate him after my losses and his missing promises. I had all conversations and all my attempts to reach him recorded as evidence.

Crypto Dispensers ,cryptodispensers.com,260,4.3,67%,5%,3%,2%,23%,1,"I am updating a review that I wrote recently regarding Crypto Dispensers and their customer service. I received a phone call from the company on Tuesday, April 18. They explained to me about some issues they had been having with changes that they were having to make due to the recent economic upheavals and that they were trying to get everything taken care of and get my bitcoin sent out. I was encouraged to believe that I should have my bitcoin by the end of this past week. The call was helpful and amiable on both sides. At the end of the call I requested an email to be sent detailing all that had been discussed so that I would have it in writing. I was assured that I would receive an email that day and they requested my email address. As soon as the call was ended, I immediately sent my email address along with a nice note reminding them to please send me the statement of what had been discussed. A couple of hours later I received a text, assuring me once again that I would get an email that day. On Friday, after not having yet received the email, nor the bitcoin, I went back to the mall where I Initially deposited my money in the crypto dispensers ATM  and I spoke with the specialty leasing manager. She placed a call to crypto dispensers and was not able to reach anyone, but was forced to leave a message, which is what happens every time you call. She stated that they needed to get back with her for the issue to be solved that day. She also sent an email  stating the same thing. Today is the close of Saturday and I have not received the email, nor have I yet received my bitcoin. There has been no response whatsoever to any of our requests for communication.",Company has responded to this review.

Crypto Dispensers ,cryptodispensers.com,260,4.3,67%,5%,3%,2%,23%,1,"Final update! These people are full of it! After generically responding to my emails reaching out to support to fulfill my reward THAT THEY EMAILED ME OFFERING, they come on this public forum and cunningly respond to my review as if they intended to help. Only to turn around and send the same email saying they haven’t received what they need from me in order to provide the incentive that once again they sought me out to engage in. They emailed me a few days after my first cash load and said hey if u like us write a 5star review and we’ll give u $10. Mind you I’ve been a customer with this company for multiple years and would use the site more if the fees weren’t so high and capabilities so minimal. However they flooded my emails with this promotion to receive $25 for first deposit, when I did it I wasn’t impressed because once again after all the fees you end up earning about $5 give or take some change! I went on about my life and here they come in my email offering an incentive to encourage 5star reviews. They didn’t follow through or respond to my emails so I had to take to this public forum which triggered a response from them. The response was remove my second review or they won’t fulfill the reward and threatened to disable my account for “abusing bonuses” DID I MENTION THEY REACHED OUT TO ME IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE OF MY REVIEW. Needless to say I told them I WILL NOT REMOVE MY REVIEW UNTIL THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR END! Their response, sorry to have to do this but it’s come to our attention you are abusing rewards so we are disabling your account! That response came promptly and directed towards me personally not a generic response given by a computer. So they had found time to follow up on this matter when i inboxed them for about 3weeks with limited responses due to them claiming to be a startup business! They’ve been around for at least 3years, their phone number that is published on the internet is no connected but they have personnel available to disable accounts yet no one on their staff to pay their phone bill or get a service they can manage to keep! BAD BUSINESS!!!",Company has responded to this review.

Crypto Dispensers ,cryptodispensers.com,260,4.3,67%,5%,3%,2%,23%,1,"DON’T FALL FOR THIS!!!!Fake platform. They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.-------------------------------------------------------------I am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.----------------------------------------------------------------This scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.------------------------------------------------------------Three more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud. I hope no one will be fooled.",Company has responded to this review.

I must say this was the smoothest Bitcoin purchase by far with no hassles and no holdups. You choose deposit cash to account, they send you an email with a scannable barcode. Take that to the cashier and load anywhere from. $20-$500 as well as a $4.95 processing fee. The money was instantly on my account but took 15 min to clear. Then I purchased my Bitcoin and it sent to my wallet immediately and my wallet verified the deposit and is waiting for the blockchain to finalize it. Super simple and duper easy. The only bad thing I must say is $12 fee for a $120 purchase was a little steep but overall very easy and i will use this method from now on.

It did work when I had it text to me for a little while but, then I needed to send more money and for 3 days I would generate a bar code bring it to the store, the store would ring it up, I would pay, then it gave the cashier a message that the barcode was not valid so, they had to delete the transaction. So, I was never able to do the transaction.  It happened at both CVS and Rite Aid.  So I went and got a new account with another company and was able to buy the bite coins I needed to send.

So I was drilled and had to send my ID, social security card, and a PGE bill to show proof of address after the fact.  Then a couple days ago the person that had all my information was able to transfer my paycheck that was deposited to my card to their account and now they have started an investigation, but unfortunately I'm the victim, I'm wondering why didn't they interrogate the person that committed the crime just like I was interrogated to try and get my money back the first time. If you requested all that information for proof of residency, they why didn't you do the same to the person on the other end of the phone. Its very unprofessional and nobody suffers but Tracy P.

You extend a helping hand and then you do not follow through. I have now lost all confidence in Netspend and feel like you do not care about helping your clients. I have called mutilple times and left numerous messages and it is completely silent on your end. I am going to to assume now that Netspend only cares about taking your money and pretending to want to help. What was the point of reaching out if you were not going to follow through. I want a call back immediately or and email response asap. this is literally the worst customer service and a i was hoping it was only from the call center but it is obvious this lack of concern goes all the way to the top of corporate and it is sad. If this is not resolved soon I will be taking this issue as far as I can so that everyone knows that Netspend are theives and to make sure no one ever goes through this again. This is embarrassing for your company and people need to know. If i do not get a response soon i will be forced to reach out to the BBB, my district attorney, my personal lawyer and the local news to report on how your company did not close a card reported stolen and over $900 in charge being taken from my account. and then how a corporate higher up reached out only because of a review I had and then offered to help and then basically ghosted me. I will make sure that it is known that Lea Campos offered to assist me but lied and never truly meant to help me at all . I will let them know I left you multiple emails and multiple voicemail messages and that you NEVR responded back. You offered your direct line and email address and then NEVER INTENDED TO ACTUALLY HELP ME ! but just pretended to offer help when she truly had no intentions of ever following through with her offer to assist. $900 was taken from my account and no one seems to care.

Netspend Corporation,aceelitecard.com,8,3.7,25%,12%,0%,13%,50%,2,"Good mornin. I'm experiencing Netspend trouble again folks. I called yesterday noon and the customer representative was trying to tell me to activate my 10th Netspend Card they've sent. I admittedly had responded to a NO! Because many times I've been charge for every card I received and every month ive paid. I'm on I pay monthly outta of my SSI check every month. So that had been including $5.00 a month plus the activation card as well.  U know none of the representatives has ever told that I didn't have to activate every time a card was being sent almost every month. I was fed up to here with them dang cards that I was being charge and token advantage by the customer rep. I've only lost one card that I got replace and yes paid for the activation charge then a coupl3 of months later someone stoled my card outta of my wallet at the grocery store. Yes I report it stolen and stop it. So yes they sent me another card that I had to pay for activation fee. Okay 2 cards were fine to pay, after a month every time I would speak to a Netspend Customer representative they would send me another card sometimes 3 times in a month. I was a dummy activating evey card I received one card would do for all the other cards was getting in the mail because it seem like every representative I would talk to they would send a darn card.I got fed up one day and ask nicely why am I receiving all these cards and all these charges I can't prove because it's in my other Galaxy phone thats broke.i can get printed copies of how many times I payed for these cards but at the same time I switch with all netspend access thinking it was going to be better but my SSI PAYMENTS ARE LATE. WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which  does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done  on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation.  I feel from my rare disease  or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangualIn damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee  below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL.

ATM Together,atmtogether.com,2,3.2,50%,0%,0%,0%,50%,1,"This is a company with some great speakers to get you involved and very little afterwards. They offer you a package to “do the work for you” which is very enticing, but also something that is far easier to do on your own than they make it sound. Opening a bank account isn’t difficult, you have to create your LLC yourself anyway, and they do provide you with videos for most things related to your machine and getting started, which has been one of the most helpful things they provide.They will find you a bank, which honestly is not that difficult, set up the processing company - the only part that I feel was useful about the whole thing, and find you a location. The location finder service is very bad about setting you up meetings with places without first checking your availability or blatantly ignoring it, causing you to then have to call the company and explain to them that you cannot make the appointment that had been set up with them and try to make a new one. They will set up a group chat of dedicated people to help you and any question that you ask will immediately be responded to by multiple people saying “looping in @____” to the person you’ve already tagged in your question before getting an answer, and half the time I’m not even sure these are real people in the group chat.  They offer a Facebook group with other people with businesses where you can ask questions and get advice, but if your question looks bad on a location of theirs, the admin won’t even approve your post. They offer a guarantee of your machine either creating an income of $200/month or the option of offering you a replacement location OR $1000 of your money back, seriously pressing that the better deal is for them to find you new locations so that you will have multiple machines. However, if you take them up on this, they will inform you that by having purchased a new machine for the new location rather than relocating the original one, that you’ve voided this guarantee and will only find you one more location instead of the maximum of either 3 or 5 outlined in the guarantee. The location finder service guy has gotten passive aggressive with his answers regarding areas that I have specifically asked to avoid, and honestly if I could go back I wouldn’t have ever invested anything into this company.

When he knew that he could have made a more informed decision. This bank has little minority representation. Look at it's employee line up in York, PA  Even the SBA was baffled by these actions when the member had all appropriate documents. Doug even went as far as giving notification to another bank to block our deposits from SBA. Any minority putting their money in this bank is perpetuating racial injustice.",Company has NOT responded to this review.

They have always gone far and beyond to help me. I do believe people need to make sure they are adding a review on the right business.",

But its has been too long for me not to use my card at my convenience to pay the company back in their store. I reached out to customer service sweet lady she did not understand why Florence muscle shoals and Athens more than likely card readers are not working for their customers.

Cash Express,cashexpressllc.com,24,2.5,34%,8%,4%,8%,46%,1,"This app is so useless and full of fraudulent acts. One of their online marketers called my phone to advertise this useless app to me, firstly I refused that I needed not to borrow, he finally convinced me. After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable. To worsen the case, a week later their online customer started sending messages, death threats, posting negative things about me. I had to call the WhatsApp number that sent me messages and this foolish girl had the nerves to start laying curses on me and my family because of a token I never bargained for. Please guys, to avoid the type of experience and embarrassment I got from these app, please I advise you avoid this app. They are thieves in disguise.",Company has NOT responded to this review.

Cash Express,cashexpressllc.com,24,2.5,34%,8%,4%,8%,46%,2,"I went into cash express on Eastern Bypass. I went in early because I got my check early. I ask the girl who waited on me if it would be a problem paying early. She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location.  I will go to the one on Main Street.
